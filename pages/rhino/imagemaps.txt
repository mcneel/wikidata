======Environment Maps======

>A place to share your custom materials, environment maps, etc. with others

Post a small example of your material or environment map image below (100 x 100 pixel image) and provide a link to the uploaded file.

**Important:** //Please give your uploaded file a unique name. If you upload a file with the same name as an existing file, it overwrites without asking.  So if you name your file map.zip, it's likely to either get overwritten or overwrite someone else's file...//

===== To create an environment map for Rhino=====

Choose the image for your e-map and load it into an image editor like Photoshop.  Crop it square. In Photoshop there is a distortion filter called **spherize**. Other programs will have something similar.  Spherize the image (in Photoshop at 100%).  Optionally, use the ellipse selection tool with Shift and select corner to corner to create a circle corresponding with the sphere. Invert the selection and delete the corners outside the sphere image. Use **Save for Web** and save the image at 256 x 256 pixels, in PNG or JPG format.  Place it in your e-map folder (your path may be different):

C:\Program Files\[[Rhinoceros 4.0 (or 3.0 or 4.0 beta)\English\Environment Maps
