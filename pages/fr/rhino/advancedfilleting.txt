====== Advanced Filleting ======
> **Summary:** //There are situations where the automatic filleting tools in Rhino may fail. This page contains tutorials that show how to manually get the desired results.//

**Contact:** [[jb@mcneel.com|John Brock]] or [[pascal@mcneel.com|Pascal Golay]]

======The two primary commands for filleting surfaces in Rhino are:======

====FilletEdge:====
  * Creates a tangent surface between multiple polysurface edges (joined) with optional varying radius values, trims the original faces, and joins the resulting surfaces together.
  * Is not limited to just two surfaces
  * Can fill in corners between adjacent fillets
  * Is limited to exactly three surfaces meeting at a point
  * The radiuses used can not be so large that they overlap each other and completely consume any surface they are following.

====FilletSrf:====
  * Creates a tangent surface between two surface edges (joined or not) with a constant radius, and optionally trims and/or extends the original surfaces.
  * Works on exactly two surfaces at a time
  * Does not fill in corners between adjacent fillets

======What if they donâ€™t work?======

| [[FourSrfReverse|{{:legacy:en:Mitch1Done.jpg}}]] |Here's an example sent in by Mitch Heynick.  Mitch writes: Fillet all vertical edges plus the base with a radius of 10.  Fillet the horizontal inside edges near the top at 5. --Mitch|
