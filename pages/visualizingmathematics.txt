===== Description =====
Mathematician **Henry Segerman** will show you beautiful and compelling 3D printed mathematical art, and in the second half of the presentation, show you how to make a “stereographic projection” shadow sculpture using Rhino. Henry will broaden your exposure to visual mathematical ideas.

===== Target Audience =====
The first part of the presentation is aimed at anyone interested in geometric art and design. The second part is for Rhino users interested in learning a new way to have geometry interact with light and shadow. No prior mathematical experience will be assumed or needed.

===== Order of Event =====

  * Intro
  * Overview of Henry Segerman’s work
  * Break for questions
  * Workshop to make a stereographic projection sphere. 
  * More questions after (and during) the workshop.
