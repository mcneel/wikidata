Rhino plays a major role in the rapid prototyping services and training courses we offer for the jewelry industry. I run H3-D, a jewelry technology specialist company. Based in the middle of London's old jewelry district, we provide CAD services, independent advisory, and education for professional jewelers and product designers.

I love Rhino so much I've rewritten McNeel's Level 1 and Level 2 Rhino training courses for jewelry designers and rapid prototyping, and had them recertified by McNeel. The goal was to help Hatton Garden maintain a professional standard of training for its designers and manufacturers. Since the start of our partnership with [[http://www.holtsacademy.com/|Holts Academy]] in 2006, we have trained more than 200 jewelers, silversmiths, sculptors, and artists from all walks of life in the use of CAD and rapid prototyping.
