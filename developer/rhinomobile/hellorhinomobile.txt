======RhinoMobile - HelloRhinoMobile======

**Mac Instructions**
  - In Xamarin Studio, open the //HelloRhinoMobile// solution.
  - Right-click the //HelloRhino.Touch// project and select //Set As Startup Project// from the drop-down menu.  This makes //HelloRhino.Touch// the active project in the build.  //HelloRhino.Touch// is the iOS target project.  (The //.Touch// suffix is a naming convention from Mono that conjures Cocoa//Touch// (the iOS library.  It is a convention that also avoids namespace collisions).
  - Verify that the build is set to //Debug// and the device to //iOS Simulator > iPhone iOS 7//.  Click the //Play/Run// button.
  - [[http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/beginning_a_xamarin_trial|Start a Xamarin Trial]].  The Xamarin Starter edition allows you to unlock a 30-day trial of the full Business Edition, which will be necessary for building and using RhinoMobile.  You will need to create a Xamarin Login.  If you are unable to start a trial after creating a login, don't worry, Xamarin Studio will prompt you to when you try to build RhinoMobile projects.
