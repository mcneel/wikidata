======Using LAN Zoo with a Proxy Server======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses how to bypass a proxy server to access a LAN Zoo server.//

Today, many organizations use proxies to protect their users from intrusion and to use smaller amounts of publicly routed IP addresses. A proxy is a server that sits between you and the Internet. It receives all client requests to the Internet, fulfills the request itself, and then sends the information to the client.

=====Bypassing a proxy server=====
There are instances where you prefer to bypass the proxy and access the website or resource directly. A example is the locally available resource, like a LAN Zoo Server, which is available through a direct network access.

Windows offers support for adding and configuring proxies inside Internet Explorerâ€™s settings.

You can choose to enable the option **Bypass Proxy Server for local addresses** to bypass any local addresses by following these steps:

  - Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  - Click **Network and Internet**, and then click **Internet Options**.
  - In the Internet Options dialog box, click the **Connections** tab.
  - Click the **LAN Settings** button.
  - Select the **Bypass proxy server for local addresses** checkbox.
  - Click **OK** to complete the proxy configuration process.
