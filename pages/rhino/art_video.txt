===== ART Frequently Asked Questions =====
**The ART Requirement of McNeel Level 1 & 2 training is designed to "teach you to teach Rhino", not learn it.** 
You should already know Rhino very well and be looking to support and teach Rhino.

**On-Demand will help you prepare for the class, however it will not fulfill the Level 1 or Level 2 requirement.**
Level 1 & Level 2 can be done for n/c in the Seattle, Miami or regional classroom.

**In the North American region, Level 1 On-line does count for your ART.** You will assist the instructor and help with chat questions for the Online to count as your ART requirement. However there are no discounts for this class. The online classes is not free, but it is already discounted for all, $200 instead of $675. You can take it no charge in Seattle, but do do need to travel and arrange accommodations.

**During the online class you will serve as TA.** You need to be present for all the sessions, monitor the Chat windows, alert instructor of issues, sometimes instructor will ask you for a review of questions. You will be trained in the orientation session. It works well, the instructors are very experienced getting the TA comfortable, and most TA's really enjoy this.

**With the Online Level 1 option, you will only travel to Seattle for the Level 2.** We can schedule a Level 2 in Seattle if you give us some input about your schedule. For example, if you think you can make here in December, give us the dates. We will try to accommodate your schedule, if possible. However, we do need to know 6 or so months in advance. So coming to Seattle //**once**// is more economical and time efficient.

**//Would the chatting interrupt my own participation?//**
If you are learning yes. 
Some take the class, and then return to TA in the next session. 
The repeat for the TA is no charge. 
The classes are recorded and you can stream for 3 months to review the lessons. So that may be enough if you miss something.

**Level 2 must be taken at your McNeel regional office, not online.** In this final Level 2 in our classroom, you are evaluated for Rhino skills and knowledge. Some ART do not pass and have to take the class a second time.  Another options is to prepare by doing the Level 2 online before coming to Seattle.   

**Again, this is all up to the region you are in.** 
In our NA region that you are in, you need to come McNeel Seattle with is the headquarters for corporate and North America.

**Last you will need to do a video tutorial and fill our the ART application.**
It generally take 6-12 month for users to get all the ART requirements done.
Please email [[mary@mcneel.com|Mary Fugier]] with any additional questions.
//Thanks for considering becoming an ART.//
