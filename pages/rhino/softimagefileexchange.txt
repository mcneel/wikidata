====== Softimage File Exchange ======

There are two options for getting [[rhino:nurbs|NURBS]] models from Rhino into Softimage. Both have their own problems and benefits.


Softimage can also import 3DS, DXF, and OBJ file formats created in Rhino.

=====Use Softimage's file utility:=====
  - From the File menu, click **Export Selected** or **Save As**.
  - In the dialog box, in the Save As Type box, select **IGES**.
  - Type a filename and click **Save**.
  - In the IGES Export dialog box, from the IGES Type box, select **Softimage**.
  - Run iges2soft.exe with the following command line switches:
   iges2soft -f -L -S3 -s3 -T5 -t3 -v3 -R [RSRC_DIR] MyIgesFile.igs MyDSCFile.dsc
   [RSRC_DIR] = Softimage resource directory (often c\soft3d_3.7\3d\bin\rsrc)
iges2soft.txt contains command line option information.

=====Use Polytrans file exchange utility=====

Polytrans by Okino can read IGES files and write Softimage files. Check out their web site for more information: www.okino.com.


=====Open Softimage=====

  - Import the file: Tools > Import > Objects > PT_IgesImport.
  - Select the database from where you want to save the imported IGES file upon conversion to Softimage format. (It is a good idea to create a new Softimage directory specifically for the task of IGES importing.)
  - Accept Phoenix Tools IGES Import default settings. The model will be translated and then appear in Softimage.
  - Select all models [spacebar+a] and rotate -90 in the X axis: Model > Effect > FreezeÂ > Rotation.
  - Save scene/model to await merging into desired Softimage scene.
