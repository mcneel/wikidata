======Convert a Rhino That Uses the Zoo to a Stand-alone License======

> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses how to convert a Rhino for Windows or Rhino for Mac installation from a network node to a stand-alone node.//

=====Question=====
By mistake, I installed one of my Rhino seats to use the Zoo, when I really intended to install it as a stand-alone  license. When I launch Rhino and go to the **Licenses** page in the **Options** dialog, the **Convert** button is disabled. I logged in as administrator and tried again, but the button is still disabled. How do I change this installation into a stand-alone node?
