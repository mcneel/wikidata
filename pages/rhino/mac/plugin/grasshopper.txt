====== Will Grasshopper run in Rhino 5 for Mac? ======
> **Summary:** //No. The Grasshopper 1 for Windows plug-in will only run in Rhino V5 for Windows, but keep reading//

Widely used plugins written for Rhino 5 for Windows can not be used in Rhino 5 for Mac.  This includes Grasshopper, Vray, Matrix, RhinoGold, etc. There are a specialized few written using RhinoCommon and Eto. These can be found on [[http://www.food4rhino.com|Food4Rhino]]. These are the only true "cross-platform" plug-ins currently.


There is an incomplete, "Work In Progress" implementation of Grasshopper 1 for Mac included in the RhinoWIP - Work In Progress (WIP) builds.  It is not production ready.  Since it is incomplete, the command name is "ExplicitHistory."

Grasshopper will not be included as part of Rhino 5 for Mac product life cycle.  Grasshopper 1 will be part of the Rhino 6 for Mac shared codebase, so Grasshopper 1 will eventually be included in Rhino 6 for Mac (if all goes according to plan).  After Rhino 6 for Windows is released, then Rhino 6 for Mac will shift to the shared version 6 codebase.  There is no estimate of when this work will be completed.

Anyone that owns a Rhino 5 for Mac license can [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/mac/wip|participate in the Rhino WIP]].
