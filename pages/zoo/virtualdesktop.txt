=====Question=====
Our school is using Microsoft [[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/multipoint|Windows MultiPoint Server]]. Is Rhino compatible with this system? 

=====Answer=====
We **do not recommend** running Rhino in Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments, such Microsoft Windows MultiPoint.

Windows MultiPoint Server is similar in functionality other VDI environments, such as Microsoft Terminal Services, Citrix Server, and others. Here is a simple description of MultiPoint Server:

//Windows MultiPoint Server addresses the problem of affordability by giving each student his or her own station with a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse; these stations are then connected to a single computer and share its processing power.//

Rhino is a very CPU, memory and graphics-intensive application. Imagine logging onto your own computer 5, 10, 20 or even 30 times and trying to run Rhino in each logon session. Performance, and perhaps reliability, will be very poor. Rhino will be unusable for anything but the most basic operations.

Technically, though, Rhino will run in this environment if it is installed as a standalone node using an Educational Lab license. **Single-user licenses will not work**.

Also, Rhino will also run in this environment if installed as a network node, using a Zoo server to distribute licenses.

Rhino 4.0 will not run in these types of environments.
