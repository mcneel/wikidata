**General Illustration - Nate at www.nateowens.com**

I use Rhino for illustration projects, usually editorial illustration, but also some commercial projects. Other software used for rendering and post processing include Carrara, PhotoShop. I use some of the things I do with Rhino as a foundation for traditional illustration (kind of like building a model to work from). For instance, I did a Christmas card with Santa riding in his sleigh. I did the sleigh in Rhino. The advantage is that I can rotate that to fit into my art. Final art looked like an oil painting (but was actually painted on the computer).
