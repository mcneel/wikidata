====== The Lighting Tab ======
The Lighting tab allows the user to create and modify light sources. Since nXt is designed to simulate real-world lighting, it includes several presets that correspond to real-world lighting situations. The drop-down box at the top of the Lighting tab allows the user to choose a preset, or to create a custom one. For more information on presets and lighting basics, click [[accurender:nxt:documentation:basic:lighting|here.]]

The lighting controls are organized into separate tabs. Which tabs are visible is dependent on which preset you choose. To make the [[accurender:nxt:documentation:reference:lighting:advanced|Advanced tab]] visible, click the Show Advanced Tab box. The other tabs are: 
  * [[accurender:nxt:documentation:reference:lighting:sky|Sky]]
  * [[accurender:nxt:documentation:reference:lighting:lights|Lights]]
  * [[accurender:nxt:documentation:reference:lighting:backgrounds|Backgrounds]]
  * [[accurender:nxt:documentation:reference:lighting:sun|Sun]]
