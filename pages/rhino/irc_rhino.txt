  - These [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/gettingstartedvideos|“PBL” tutorials]] (project based learning) will take the student from a blank screen to a completed model in under 2 hours.
  - Test for their Rhino skills with the IRC testing Level 1 and Level 2 with  [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/academic_certified_test|Rhino Academic testing]]. Testing is available at a discount to schools. Here is the application to offer the test to your students.

==== After your school certifies a student what are the next steps? ====
  * Once the student has earned their certification, all the teacher needs to do is let their CTE Director know so the director can do their reporting to OSPI.
