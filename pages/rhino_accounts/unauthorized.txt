====== Prevent unauthorized account access ======

Do you have a Rhino license assigned to your Rhino account (not a team!) and are you seeing Rhino in use on computers that you do not recognize? If so, follow the steps below to prevent unauthorized access to your Rhino account and the Rhino license(s) associated with it.

  - [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/?controller=emails|Remove any email addresses]] in your account that you do not recognize.
  - If you have a password, [[https:https://accounts.rhino3d.com/?controller=change_password|reset it]].
  - [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/?controller=foreign_accounts|Remove any linked accounts]] (e.g. Google) that you do not recognize.
  - Go to [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/?controller=login_sessions|Security > Login Activity]] and invalidate any sessions that they don’t recognise. The current session cannot be selected on purpose, so if you’re not sure, just select all others and then click //Invalidate Selected// in the //Action// menu.
  - Next, go to [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/?controller=permissions|Security > Permissions]] and revoke access for the “Rhinoceros” app.
  - Start (or restart) Rhino.
