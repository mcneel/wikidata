======Installing Penguin 2.0======

> **Summary:** //How to script the installation of [[penguin:home|Penguin]]//


[[penguin:home|Penguin]] installation scripting is similar to Rhino and Flamingo.

The format of the command line you usually execute from a batch file (*.bat) is:

   msiexec /i <path to installer .msi> /qn <license-options>

The license-options parameters are:

  * **LICENSE_PRODUCTKEY="PE20-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"** Use the 20-character Penguin CD-Key, without the //PE20// characters. This parameter is mandatory unless you install Penguin as a workgroup node.
  * **ZOO_NETWORK="network"** "network" means you want [[penguin:home|Penguin]] to get its license from the Zoo server. This parameter is not mandatory.
  
=====Examples=====

   "msiexec /i Penguin20_Release_SR4_x64.msi /qn LICENSE_PRODUCTKEY="PE20-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX""

   "msiexec /i Penguin20_Release_SR4_x86.msi /qn ZOO_NETWORK="network""

=====Notes=====
  * **Important:** You must run command line with administrator privileges.
  * If you need a log file, you can add **/L*v "Setup.log** text piece to the command line.
  * The SR5 version does not allow specifying the type of license during the installation. You must to specify it during the first execution.
