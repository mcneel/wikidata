This an in-depth, hands-on, three-day workshop. Rhino educational resources like Rhino in Education posts, Rhino Curriculum Guide, expertise from the instructors & fellow teachers will guide us during this workshop. 
A major goal of the workshop is to get your students working in 3d with Rhino on day-one in your classes. 

Participants should be able to develop skills and projects that fit the output tools available in their own labs. The instructors and host teacher have years of classroom knowledge and expertise.  The output tools available will be different at each teaching lab; not all labs will have the same devices.
 
We need to remember the reason for the workshop is to practice working with Rhino and gaining skills, strategies, and knowledge for the classroom.  Bring a blank Flash Drive so you can take models, projects, and information back with you.  

  * The lab will provide IT support at the beginning of each day to help folks log onto computers and pull up the software.
  * Lab will be setup with 20 computers with Rhino 6 for Mac. 
  * Additional seating for 10 folks that want to bring their own laptops (with Rhino already downloaded) will be available. 
  * Filament 3D printers and laser cutter will be available but you will need to provide your own filament. Email host organizer for type and source of filament.
  * We will also operate the Laser Cutter during the workshop with certified materials. Email host organizer with any questions.
  * All participants will need to sign safety waivers. We can provide them on the 1st day of the workshop. 
  * A Smart Park parking garage is located on Davis and Natio (one block from the building). It is $18 per day to park.
