====== Rhino 8 Mac with Enscape Reporting "License Not Found" ======
Rhino 8 Mac with Enscape installed, sometimes reports "License not found" error and will not open.

{{:rhino:mac:home:license_not_found.png?300|}}

This happens because Rhino was not initialized  before Enscape was install and Enscape created ~/Library/Application Support/McNeel with wrong permissions.

The "fix" is to remove Enscape and all supporting files and then re-install and run Rhino **first** before re-installing Enscape.
 
  - Ordered List Item Restart your Mac.
  - Make sure Rhino 8 is not running.
  - Launch Terminal.
  - Remove the folders that Enscape created.
     - If Rhino 7 is installed and working and you only want to fix Rhino 8, run **rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0**
     - Or, run **rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel**
  - Start Rhino 8
  - With Rhino successfully starting, now you can reinstall Enscape
  - if you get "permissions denied" as a return when you run the steps above, add the prefix **sudo** then a space, then the command string above. This will call the admin credentials dialog box allowing you to enter admin credentials. Enter admin credentials and the command string should complete successfully. 
  - If all the above fails, you can browse directly to the folder in the finder and delete the folder manually by dragging it into the trash. (confirm with admin credentials) 
  - In some rare cases all the above fails, BUT after a restart the above process finally works.
