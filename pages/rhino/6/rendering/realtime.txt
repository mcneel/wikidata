=====Overview=====


Rhino 6 includes advanced realtime rendering modes. Use these modes to create quick high-quality renderings for design presentation.  For a basic understanding of realtime rendering in Rhino V6 watch this video (3 minutes):

=====Setting up a rendering=====

=====Additional render settings=====

There are many setting that can be changed to improve the rendering. Take a tour through some of the settings beyond the defaults. 

===Environment===

If you do not like the reflections or would like to see the model in a different scene, change the environment.

===Groundplane===

Rhino 6's new groundplane features can really create a good based to build your rendering from.

===Snapshots===

Use snapshots to create multiple graphical presentations of the same model. \\ (6 minutes) |

===Saving an image from the Display modes===

=====Decals=====

Decals are textures and images placed on the model in a specific location.  Normally these images are placed in a very specific location.  Kyle covers both basic and intermediate ways of using decals on the model.
