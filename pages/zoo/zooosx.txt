===== Question =====
If we want to use Rhino for Mac with the LAN Zoo, then we need to host it on a Windows system, as the LAN Zoo only runs on Microsoft Windows. Is there any plan on porting the LAN Zoo to Apple macOS?

===== Answer =====
No, we currently have no plans of porting the LAN Zoo to macOS. If something changes, then we will make an announcement on our [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/|Discourse]] discussion forum.

If you do not have a Windows system to run the LAN Zoo, then you can use [[http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion-pro/|VMWare Fusion Pro]], which allows you to run a Windows virtual system on a macOS system.
