===== Download and Install =====


Is there anything special we need to do before upgrading to the new version? 

Many of our users have checked out licenses. Do they need to check them back in before upgrading?

===== Answer =====
Zoo 7 is an in-place upgrade to Zoo 6. That is, once Zoo 7 is installed, Zoo 6 will no longer exist. 

The installation of Zoo 7 only replaces the Zoo application - it will not affect any licenses you already have added. And, installing Zoo 7 will not affect any users who are running Rhino at the time.

So, it is safe to install Zoo 7 at almost any time. The installation takes all of about 15 seconds. However, to be safe, do it at a time that users are not using their Rhino software.
