====== What is a WIP? ======
> **Summary:** //What is the Rhino for Mac WIP version?//

WIP stands for Work-In-Progress.  It is our form of //beta//. Often it is released in parallel with a stable commercial release but the WIP contains experimental or half-finished features.  WIPs are generally available to anyone who owns the commercial or educational version of the software.  The WIP can be unstable, have bugs, and contain unfinished features.
