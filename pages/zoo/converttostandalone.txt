======Convert a Rhino That Uses the LAN Zoo to a Stand-alone License======

=====Question=====
By mistake, I installed one of my Rhino seats to use the LAN Zoo, when I really intended to install it as a stand-alone  license. When I launch Rhino and go to the **Licenses** page in the **Options** dialog, the **Convert** button is disabled. I logged in as administrator and tried again, but the button is still disabled. How do I change this installation into a stand-alone node?

=====Answer=====
To convert a Rhino installation from a network node to a stand-alone node, follow these steps:

==== Windows ====

1. Login to the workstation as the Administrator or as a user with administrative rights.

2. Run Windows Explorer.

3. Navigate to the following folder:
  C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Rhinoceros\<version>\License Manager\Licenses

> **Note:** //By default, Microsoft has hidden the ProgramData folder. You can either use **Folder Options** to allow display of hidden files and folders, or you can type **%ProgramData%** in the address bar in Windows Explorer to navigate to it.//

4. Delete the following file (if found):
  // Rhino 7
  59ff75c9-9c71-4ef8-a290-6b590f3fc63a.lic
  
  // Rhino 6
  55500d41-3a41-4474-99b3-684032a4f4df.lic
  
  // Rhino 5

5. Navigate to the following folder:
  C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Roaming\McNeel\Rhinoceros\<version>\License Manager\Licenses

> **Note:** //By default, Microsoft has hidden your AppData folder. You can either use **Folder Options** to allow display of hidden files and folders, or you can type **%AppData%** in the address bar in Windows Explorer to navigate to it.//

6. Delete the following file (if found):
  // Rhino 7
  59ff75c9-9c71-4ef8-a290-6b590f3fc63a.lic
  
  // Rhino 6
  55500d41-3a41-4474-99b3-684032a4f4df.lic
  
  // Rhino 5

7. Right-click in the Rhino shortcut and pick **Run as Administrator**.

8. Enter and validate your Rhino license key.

====macOS====

There are two ways to change Rhino for Mac licenses.  

The first - and easiest - way is to run Rhino for Mac, then navigate to //Preferences...// > //Licenses// > //Change your license key//

If the method above does not work, you may need to delete your license file and enter a new one.  Make sure you have your license code recorded before you attempt the following steps:

1. Quit Rhino for Mac and switch to the Finder application.

2. Navigate to //Finder// > //Go// > //Go to Folder...// and enter the following folder:
  /Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/License Manager/Licenses

3. Delete the license file contained in the //Licenses// folder.

4. Launch Rhino for Mac again.

5. Enter and validate your Rhino license key.
