=====Display Troubleshooting: Performance =====

>Some techniques to improve display speed.

  * Make sure **drivers** are [[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:failure|up to date]].
  * **Hide** objects you are not working on: If objects are not visible they do not affect the display speed. Use the **Hide** command or **Layers** to adjust visibility.
  * Try different **display modes** (**Wireframe**, **Shaded**, **Rendered**, **Technical**...)
  * Create **custom render meshes** for the objects in your model. Small parts can often have fewer polygons in their render meshes and still look smooth from a distance. You can find custom mesh control per object in the **Object Properties** panel. 
  * Turn off the display of **isocurves** in the **Display** panel. This changes the active display mode only. 
  * If you are working with a polygonal mesh model, turn off the display of **mesh wires** when using shaded display modes.  
  * If you have many **repeated objects** in the model and don't need them to be NURBS, convert them all to meshes and then join these into one mesh object. Don't forget to then hide the original NURBS objects. 
  * Reset your display mode to the default settings in **Rhino Options** > **View** > **Display Modes**.
  * Setting **BBox Display** in the **Display** panel (Panels menu > Display) will speed view rotation in large or complex scenes by temporarily degrading the display to only display object bounding boxes.


**Is the problem solved?**
  * **Yes**. Yay!\\
  * **No.**
