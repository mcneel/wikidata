======Features of the Zoo======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:zoo5|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //A review of the features of Zoo 5.//

=====Overview=====
The Zoo lets you share Rhino, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, and Bongo licenses (CD-Keys) among users on the same network workgroup. When these products are installed as the workgroup nodes instead of stand-alone, it works like this: 

  * When a workgroup node starts, it requests a license from the Zoo. 
  * An unused license is assigned to the node. 
  * When a node shuts down, the license is returned to the Zoo's license pool. 

** The Zoo is free!**

//Note: it is possible to have both Zoo 4.0 and Zoo 5 running on the same network, and even installed on the same server, without conflict.//

=====Features=====
  * **No extra costs.** Special versions of Rhino, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, or Bongo are not needed. 
  * **No special hardware needed.** The Zoo will run on any Windows-based system. 
  * **No special software needed.** The Zoo will run on any Windows system that supports Microsoft .Net Framework 4, including Windows XP and newer.
  * **Simple setup.** Install the Zoo on any Windows-based system, and enter the license keys into the Zoo instead of the individual systems. 
  * **Check out.** License keys can be checked out so laptop users can disconnect from the network. The key can be checked in again when the laptop is reconnected to the network. 
  * **Robust.** Network nodes will keep working even if the network connection or server is down.
  * **Routable.** The Zoo works on both single-segments networks, or networks where systems are separated by routers. 
  * **Runs as a service.** If you reboot the system with the Zoo, the Zoo will automatically start up. 

=====What's New in Zoo 5?=====
  * **New Version.** Zoo 5 is a brand new version of the Zoo. Completely rewritten, Zoo 5 provides a number of new features not found in prior Zoo versions
  * **Standard Internet Protocol Support.** Clients communicate with Zoo 5 using **HTTP (Port 80)** protocol. This makes it much easier for system administrators to route Zoo requests on complex networks or even over the Internet.
  * **Firewall Friendly.** Zoo 5 requires the client to periodically check with the server, but never initiates connections back to the client. Administrators no longer need to open firewall ports on client machines.
  * **Limited License Check Out.** Prior Zoo version allows for license check out to support laptop users or for business travel. But there was no limit to the check out duration. Zoo 5 allows the administrator to specify the license check out duration.
  * **Third-Party Plug-in Support** Prior Zoo version only maintained licenses for McNeel product. Zoo 5 allows 3rd party plug-in developers to add support for their products to the Zoo.
