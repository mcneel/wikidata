====== Upgrading a Zoo Server ======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Upgrading a Zoo server.//

If you are running an older version of the LAN Zoo, you will need to upgrade to **LAN Zoo 7** or the [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino_accounts/home|Cloud Zoo]] in order to support Rhino 7. 

//Consider migrating to the [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino_accounts/home|Cloud Zoo]] instead...//
===== Download and Install =====
  * [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/zoo/7/latest|Download the LAN Zoo 7 here...]]
  * Install where in that same local as your current LAN Zoo



===== FYI =====
  * Zoo 7 is an in-place upgrade to Zoo 6. That is, once Zoo 7 is installed, Zoo 6 will no longer exist. 

  * The installation of Zoo 7 only replaces the Zoo application - it will not affect any licenses you already have added. And, installing Zoo 7 will not affect any users who are running Rhino at the time.

  * So, it is safe to install Zoo 7 at almost any time. The installation takes all of about 15 seconds. However, to be safe, do it at a time that users are not using their Rhino software.
