> 31.08.15 - Update of this page is in progress, MicMacTools is almost done and will be added soon

=====Mitch Heynick's scripted utilities page=====

This page has links to a number of scripts I have created over the years for myself and others.

  * The **MaqueTools toolset** is a collection of toolbars with both vb and Python scripts loaded in them - these can only be used in Rhino for Windows.
 
  * The **MicMacTools toolset** is a collection of Python scripts that run from aliases, and are principally aimed at use with Mac Rhino (although they will also run in Rhino for Windows).

Both of these toolsets will only run in Rhino V5 or later, as they contain Python-based scripts which will not run in earlier versions of Rhino.  All new scripts are being developed in Python for reasons of cross-platform compatibility, the remaining vb-based scripts in MaqueTools will soon be replaced with Python equivalents. 

Large thanks to Dale, Steve, Pascal, @ McNeel  as well as all the other scriptomaniacs that hang out on the Rhino scripting forum for all the help and support over the years!
====MaqueTools toolbar====

This toolset comes in the form of a master toolbar with flyouts.  I chose this form as it is easily portable and installable in any Rhino.  If you prefer to work with aliases, you might want to install the MicMacTools instead.

I use many of these tools every day, those have been more or less thoroughly tested, but there still may be bugs in some of them. [[rhinoceros@swissrhino.com|If you find a bug or failure, please report it to me]] (preferably with an example file) so I can fix it.  I try to make this stuff as reliable, user-friendly and bulletproof as possible, but there are no absolute guarantees - use at your own risk.

== What's in the collection? ==

{{people:maquetools_explanations_v11.pdf|Here is a PDF file with a short description of the current toolset}} \\ 
- //over 100 tools currently (v1.1, 10.10.2013)//

{{people:maquetools.zip|Download the V5 toolbars set plus the PDF in a Zip file here}}
==How do I install MaqueTools?==
The toolset is offered as a single V5 .rui file.  These may be imported into Rhino V5 for Windows in the usual fashion [[rhino:toolbarimports |(see here if you don't know how)]], otherwise, they may simply be opened as a separate workspace.  

Once open, you may copy the topmost button (MaqueTools) into your normal workspace.  You may then close the MaqueTools main toolbar (if you don't want it open all the time) and use the copied button to recall it when needed.  In V5, you can also dock the main toolbar as a tab if you are using the tabbed workspace.  

Alternatively, you may copy individual buttons or toolbars to your own workspace as desired, or even edit the buttons and pull out the scripts behind.  If you are copying scripts to modify/pass on, please credit the original author - me - there are no scripts from other people in this set...
== Why aren't there image icons for all the buttons? ==

I don't have the time to design/implement button images for all, but if anyone is interested, I will be happy to accept contributions of images for the next version.  LOL
