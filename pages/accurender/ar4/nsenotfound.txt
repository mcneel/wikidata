====== NSE not found error message ======

In rare cases the installation procedure fails to register a required component of AccuRender 4.  This can be solved by downloading, unzipping and double-clicking on this file.

[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/Register_AccuRender_Libraries.zip|Register_AccuRender_Libraries.zip]]

After running the batch file, you should get the message:

"DllRegisterServer in c:\program files\common files\McNeel Shared\AccuRender Libraries\ar4_nse3.dll succeeded."

Then restart [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]].
