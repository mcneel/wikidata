======How to Send a Rhino Crash Report======

If Rhino crashes, send in a crash report so that it can be included in //things that need fixed//.

  *   Can you repeat the crash? If so, the developers would like the specific details necessary to repeat the crash. A repeatable problem is the only good way to find and fix software problems.
  *   If there is enough memory available when Rhino crashes, the crash report system starts. Enter your email address and describe what you were trying to do when Rhino crashed. A short list of the commands you were using just prior to the crash can be helpful.
  *   If possible, check the box to send your 3DM file with the report.
  *   If you include your email address and a description, **your report is analyzed by a human**. If you do not include your email address and a description, we use an automated process to analyze the crash report.
