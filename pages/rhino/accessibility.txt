Accessibility tools provide options for people who have learning, vision, hearing, and mobility impairments. 

Even if Rhino relies heavily on Windows and Mac’s accessibility features our development is centered on our users and we won’t make an exception. We’ve made Rhino’s UI quite customizable and we’ve given our users the possibility to create their own templates. We believe that by allowing it our users will work better but it will also suit unique needs. 

If you are a new Rhino user we suggest going through the following:
