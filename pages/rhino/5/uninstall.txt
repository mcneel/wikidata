====== Manually Uninstalling Rhino 5======
\\
=====Problem=====
During the removal of Rhino, you get an error message like "Can't Uninstall - Feature is unavailable (path)".

This applies to Rhino 5.

=====Cause=====
The Windows Installer cache cannot find a file required for uninstall.

=====Solution=====

Manually remove Rhino and the Windows Installer registration for the product.

===Try standard program uninstall==
  - Go to Windows Start menu
  - Select **Control Panel**
  - Select **Add/Remove programs**
  - Find any Rhinoceros 5 entries and select **uninstall**


**Note:** You should only do the following procedures if uninstall fails from the Programs and Features section of the Control Panel.

  
===Stop the McNeel Update Service===
  - From the **Start** menu, click **Control Panel**, then click **Administrative Tools**.
  - In Administrative Tools, double-click **Services**.
  - In the Services dialog, scroll down to **McNeel Update (32-bit)**. (On 64-bit computers, you may have McNeel Update (64-bit) instead, or both, depending on which versions of Rhino 5 you have installed.)
  - Right-click **McNeel Update (32-bit)**, then click **Stop**.
  - On 64-bit Windows, also stop the **McNeel Update (64-bit)** service.
  
===Delete the Rhino install folder===
  - Browse the //C:\Program Files\// folder and delete the Rhinoceros 5 directory.
  - Browse the //C:\Program Files (x86)\// folder and delete the Rhinoceros 5 directory.
  - If you find the **Rhinoceros 5.0 WIP** folder in either of the above directories, delete it. 
  - Note that you might not be able to delete **RhinoShExt.dll**. That's ok. Leave the system folder with that one file and delete everything else.
  
===Delete Registry keys===
  - Open the **Registry Editor:**
    - On Windows XP: From the **Start menu**, click **Run**, then type **RegEdit** and press **Enter**.
    - On Windows Vista and Windows 7: Click the **Start** button, then type **RegEdit** and press **Enter**.
  - Browse to //HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros//.
  - Delete the 5.0 key.
  - Browse to //HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros//.
  - Delete the 5.0 key.
