====== Mitch's First Fillet Problem ======

> **Summary:** //Here's an example sent in by Mitch Heynick.  Mitch writes: Fillet all vertical edges and the base with a radius of 10.  Fillet the horizontal inside ones near the top at 5. --Mitch//
**Note:** V5 FilletEdge handles this correctly if all the edges are filleted at once.

\\

| {{:legacy:en:Mitch1_02.jpg}} | Use ExtractSrf and Join to separate the top and the base.  Use FilletEdge (R=10) to fillet all of the desired edges.  Then Explode everything. |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:Mitch1_03.jpg}}  | Use FilletSrf (R=5, Extend=Yes, Trim=Yes) to fillet the vertical side surfaces of the top and base (Black). |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:Mitch1_04.jpg}}  | Use FilletSrf (R=10) and fillet the 5mm surfaces made in the previous step. |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:Mitch1_05.jpg}}  | Untrim the vertical corner fillet surfaces, then Trim them with the edges of the small corner fillet surface made in the previous step. |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:Mitch1_06.jpg}}  | Repeat this process on each corner and join into a closed solid. |
