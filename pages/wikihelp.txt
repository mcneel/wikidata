====== Please Improve This Wiki (WikiHelp) ======
> **Summary:** //Wiki is about people participating in what's written.  This web site is intended for **you** to read and (maybe) change it.//

=====What is a Wiki?=====

A Wiki is a web site that allows easy public online editing of web-based content. This particular wiki is based on the [[http://www.dokuwiki.org|DokuWiki]] engine. Registered users can edit any of the wiki pages.

=====Wiki Formatting=====
Please read [[wiki:syntax|about formatting]] to make nice looking pages.

=====Participation=====

We welcome responsible participation. Unfortunately we can't allow everyone to just start creating and editing pages due to potential damage inflicted by wiki spamming systems. If you want to edit the wiki please contact [[steve@mcneel.com|Steve Baer]] and he will set up an account for you.

Don't worry if you do make a mistake, it's pretty easy to revert to previous versions.

**Don't abuse the Wiki**: We are trying to keep this wiki as open as possible for people to share quality information with others about McNeel related products. Please refrain from destroying content or messing it up. Thanks
