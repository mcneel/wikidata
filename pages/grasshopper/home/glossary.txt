**A glossary of Grasshopper terms**

  * **Item**: A single datum (piece of data). Items can either contain a value, or they can be empty which Grasshopper will call 'Null'.
  * **List**: An ordered collection of data. Ordered meaning there's a first, second, third, .... last item. Items inside lists are accessed by 'index'.
  * **Tree**: An ordered collection of lists. Lists are accessed by 'path'.
  * **Path**: An ordered collection of one or more non-negative integers. Usually written using curly braces and semi-colons as separators: `{0;7;0;2}` Just as you cannot have more than one item in list with the same index, you also cannot have more than one list in a tree with the same path.
