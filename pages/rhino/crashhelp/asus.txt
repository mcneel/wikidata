====== ASUS systems with multiple monitors may not start Rhino ======


ASUS computers include a utility called **Sonic Suite 2**; a third-party tool authored by **Volute**, for on-screen tools for audio functions.

On ASUS computers running single monitors, it seems to work fine.

On some ASUS computers running **extra monitors**, Rhino may not start because of this utility.

The fix is to uninstall this troublesome tool.

In **Control Panel**, **Programs** and **Features**, find:
**ProductDaemonSetup** and is installed by **ASUSTeKcomputer**
and **remove** it.

Since it is a running Windows Service, you may have to restart Windows.

Then Rhino should start.
