====== Quad Buffering 3D Mode ======

Rhino 8 now supports "Quad Buffering" which is what is needed for Passive/Active stereo viewing.

The Quad Buffering support in V8 is for hardware like **PluraVision 3D** and passive stereo viewing from people like **Schneider Digital**.

Quad Buffering does this need to be turned on in Rhino 8 and requires you enable "3D mode" in Windows display settings, as well as the GPU manufacturer's control panel.
