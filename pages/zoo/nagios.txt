[[http://www.nagios.org/|Nagios]] is an open source computer system monitoring, network monitoring, and infrastructure monitoring software application. Nagios offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications, and services. It alerts you when things go wrong and alerts you a second time when the problem is resolved.

=====More information=====
There is now a [[http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/%2A-Plugin-Packages/check-mcneel-zoo-license-servers/details|Zoo plug-in for Nagios]] available. This plug-in checks McNeel Zoo License servers for activity and license use per product. Once all licenses of one product are in use the plug-in throws a warning.
