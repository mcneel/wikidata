We are moving over to .MSI installers for Rhino 4.0 and Flamingo 2.0, but Rhino 3.0 is not using them. [Pascal Golay - 2005-11-10]


=====What gets changed when I install Rhino 3.0 from CD?=====

The user chooses a base folder for the Rhino install. The main program files go into the //System// subfolder, the many plug-ins (*.rhp and supporting files) go in the //Plug-ins// subfolder, and for each language installed, a language folder (like //English//) is created, with subfolders //Help//, //Getting Started//, //Environment Maps//, //Scripts//, //Sample Models// and //Tutorials//.

Template and toolbar files are installed under **...Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\McNeel\Rhinoceros\3.0**.  The templates are different for each language, in separate folders.

Registry entries are made in //HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\McNeel\Rhinoceros\3.0//.    Under the //3.0// key is a subkey for the date of Rhino, like //2004-04-21// where the entries for that date of Rhino are placed.

The key //Plug-ins// under the date key has subkeys like //12D31EFD-D3EE-4BCF-A856-D01320BB19F3//, which is unique for each plug-in.  This key and the keys and values in it trigger Rhino to load the plug-in when Rhino launches.

The key //<locale_ID>// (like //1033// for English) under the date contains the paths for finding the English language resources like Help.

A few entries are made in //HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\McNeel\Rhinoceros\3.0//, and this is where Rhino saves its Options, mostly under the subkey //Scheme: Default//.   For more on Schemes see the Help file. The //HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\McNeel\Rhinoceros\3.0\Global Options// key has a few settings that apply to all schemes.
