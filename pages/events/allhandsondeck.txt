This is the first time that **DECK (Design, Engineering, Computaion, Knowledge)** will be presented in  the United States.  Following the architectural stylings of Frank Ghery and Zahan Hadid Rhino scripting allows for exploration of greater organic shapes and designs. We will also have a 3D printer from Dimension to print our 3D models.   Currently there are 20 students from Lynden signed up for the class - June 22 - June 26 2009.
