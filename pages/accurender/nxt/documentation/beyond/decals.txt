====== Decals ======

Decals are non-tiling image maps which you apply directly to objects (instead of indirectly via the object's material.)  Decals can be used to represent a variety of visual phenomena, including a painting hung on the wall, labels on jars, printed signs, etc.

**Use the following steps to apply a decal to an object:**

  - Expand the Object Properties tab on the nXt Palette
  - Select the object
  - Right-click on the Decals list and select New
  - Select either Planar or Cylindrical Decal as appropriate
  - Follow the prompts at the command line (make sure to Accept the decal by pressing Enter when finished)

The decal will appear in the list anytime the object is selected.

**To remove a decal from an object:**

  - Expand the Object Properties tab on the nXt Palette
  - Select the object
  - Right click on the decal you wish to remove
  - Select Remove

 
The decal will no longer appear in the list when the object is selected

**To reposition an existing decal:**

  - Expand the Object Properties tab on the nXt Palette
  - Select the object
  - Right click on the decal you wish to reposition
  - Select Edit Position and Orientation
  - Follow the prompts to reposition (make sure to Accept the decal by pressing Enter when finished)

**To change the surface properties of a decal:**

  - Expand the Object Properties tab on the nXt Palette
  - Select the object
  - Right click on the decal you wish to edit  
  - Select Properties...

The Decal Properties dialog box will appear allowing you to change many of the surface properties of your decal.
