You can enable IntelliSense for the Rhino SDK by performing the following steps.

  - Using Visual Studio, create a new //Utility// project and name it //RhinoSDK//.
  - On the //Project// menu, select **Add to Project->Files...** and select all the header files for the Rhino SDK folder (C:\Program Files\Rhino 3.0 SDK\inc).
  - Save and close the project.
  - Open the plug-in project that you are working on.
  - On the //Project// menu, select **Insert Project Into Workspace...**. Select your new utility project.
  - **Note:** You may need to right-click on your plug-in project, in either ClassView or FileView, to reset it as the active project.
  - You should now have Intellisense for the Rhino SDK.
  - Repeat the above steps if you want IntelliSense enabled for [[developer:opennurbs:home|openNURBS]] and RMAMfcUi headers.
