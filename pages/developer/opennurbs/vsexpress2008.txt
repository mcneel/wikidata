====== Using openNURBS 5 with Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition ======

> **Developer:** //[[developer:opennurbs:home|openNURBS]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses using the openNURBS toolkit with Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition.//

To build the openNURBS toolkit with Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition, you need to make a few modifications in the openNURBS solution. 

===== Fix 1 =====
When building opennurbs.vcproj, you will receive the following error:

<code>
.\opennurbs.rc(10) : fatal error RC1015: cannot open include file 'afxres.h'.
</code>

Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition does not come with MFC. To fix this error, replace:

<code>
#include "afxres.h"
</code>

with:

<code>
#include <windows.h>
</code>

in opennurbs.rc.

===== Fix 2 =====
When building any of projects included with openNURBS, you will receive the following warning:

<code>
cl : Command line warning D9035 : option 'Wp64' has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
</code>

//Note, this is only a warning and not an error.//

To get rid of this warning, modify the settings for each of the openNURBS projects and remove the /Wp64 compiler flag. 

===== Fix 3 =====
When linking the Release build of opennurbs.vcproj, you will receive the following warning:

<code>
LINK: warning LNK4224: /OPT:NOWIN98 is no longer supported; ignored.
</code>

//Note, this is only a warning and not an error.//

To get rid of this warning, modify the settings for each of the openNURBS projects and remove the /OPT:NOWIN98 linker flag. 

===== Fix 4 =====
When building example_gl.vcproj, you receive the following error:

<code>
.\example_gl.cpp(24) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'GL/GLaux.h': No such file or directory.
</code>

//Note, this error only effects the building of the Example_GL example project. It has no effect on the openNURBS toolkit.//

Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition does not come with OpenGL support. To build this project, you need to download the [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279|Microsoft Platform SDK]].
