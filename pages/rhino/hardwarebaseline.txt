====== Hardware Guidelines for Rhinoceros 5 ======
Robert McNeel & Associates does not do extensive or scientific hardware testing. We rely on reports from users (either directly through technical support or on the [[http://v5.rhino3d.com/|Forum]]) and our own hardware purchases for opinions on what equipment works best with Rhino. 

Therefore, we do not provide any kind of hardware recommendations for running Rhino, only **baseline requirements or guidelines**.  We do recommend that you purchase the most "state of the art" computer possible when building a new system. 

==== Buy ====
  * **The fastest the processor (CPU)**.
  * **The fastest the hard drive**.
  * **A card that supports Rhino's display features**.
    * Generally this means good OpenGL support. Also the more video memory you have the more efficient Rhino will be with its display features. However, the more video memory on the card, the more expensive the price of the card. See more details on video cards [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/rhino5videocards|here]].
  * **Lots of RAM Memory** 
    * The more you have, the better things will be. Rhino 5 64-bit can use all of this.
    * It is not uncommon to find Rhino user with 16GB~32GB on their computers.
  * **Solid State Hard Drives (SSD)**
    * This improves drives access greatly. 

Ask your hardware provider what is currently the "fastest" available. This is a "moving target". Also ask the Rhino Community through the [[http://v5.rhino3d.com/|Forum]] what works and what they like. Again this is always changing.

It is also recommended that you buy a computer that offers a 30 day return policy. Test it with Rhino and other applications heavily during this period and return it if it does not meet your expectations.

==== More on video cards ====

  * In general, look for cards that will support all of Rhino’s display features. However, performance and speed is highly subjective and results are mostly determined by an individual’s level of expectations. 
  * We have never seen any measurable advantages of choosing the Quadro over the GeForce model card, as both appear to perform and run Rhino in much the same way. 
  * So it really comes down to cost and budgeting, and GeForce cards are usually significantly less money, but certainly are not less in power or performance.
  * This is very subjective, and very dependent on the actual meshes, their size and even their topology. There is no way anyone can know for certain how well Rhino is going to meet some user’s expectations based on which video card they buy. 
  * In summary, money spent on video card does not translate into speed.

  * User reports GeForce GTX 680 w/4GB is very good with Rhino. The GeForce is far cheaper than the Quadro as well.

Here is a great list showing [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/t/holomark-2-released/8040|customer results and various system configuration benchmarks]].
