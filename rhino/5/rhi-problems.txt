=====Troubleshooting RHI Installers=====

**RHI** files are **RH**ino **I**nstaller Packages.\\
They are designed to simplify installation of Rhino plug-ins.

==== Installation Problems ====
-->Windows can't open this file#
**Cause:** Windows doesn't have the file associations set correctly for RHI files.
\\
**Solution:**
  - In Control Panel, open Programs and Features
  - Right-click Rhinoceros 5, then click Repair
  - Right-click Rhinoceros 5 64-bit, then click Repair
  - Double-click your RHI installer to install.
\\
If this doesn't work, please follow the instructions for **Manually Associating RHI Files** below.

-->Package Not Compatible#
There are a few possible reasons this error can occur. The most likely are first:
  - **Corrupt Download:** a corrupt RHI file that cannot be installed. This often is the result of an incomplete download. Please delete the RHI file, clear your web browser's temporary files, and download again.
  - **Poorly Authored RHI:** if you are a developer, you may have not properly created the RHI file. Please review instructions for [[developer/rhinoinstallerengine/authoring|authoring RHI files]].
