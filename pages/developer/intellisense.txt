> **Summary:** //Discuss how to enable Visual Studio's IntelliSense feature with the Rhino SDK.//

You can enable IntelliSense for the Rhino SDK by performing the following steps.

  - Using Visual Studio, create a new "Utility" project and name it "RhinoSDK".
  - On the "Project" menu, select "Add to Project->Files..." and select all the header files for the Rhino SDK folder (C:\Program Files\Rhino 3.0 SDK\inc).
  - Save and close the project.
  - Open the plug-in project that you are working.
  - On the "Project" menu, select "Insert Project Into Workspace...". Select your new utility project.
  - Note, you may need to right click on your plug-in project, in either ClassView or FileView, to reset it as the active project.
  - You should now have intellisense for the Rhino SDK.
  - Repeat the above steps if you want IntelliSense enabled for [[developer:opennurbs:home|opennurbs]] and RMAMfcUi headers.
