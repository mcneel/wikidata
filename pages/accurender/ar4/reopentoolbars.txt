====== Re-open AccuRender 4 Toolbars ======
How do I reopen my AccuRender 4 toolbars in [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2006?

[[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2006 uses the CUI file instead of the menu file for configuring the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] user interface. This includes menu, toolbars, workspaces and more. Opening a toolbar is possible from the CUI command. We have found that using the Toolbar command without the dialog is an easier and quicker way to re-open closed toolbars. There are three methods below from which you can choose and they will work the same in all versions of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] including 2006. Which one you use will depend on your familiarity with [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] customization.

> **Note:** //AccuRender 4 must be fully loaded and operational these work-arounds to work.//

=====Method 1 - The Command Line=====

There are five toolbars in the AccuRender 4 CUI/menu.

They are: AccuRender, Render, Docking Manager Windows, File and Commands.

To re-open these toolbars, do the following:

  * 1. At the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] command line type //-toolbar//.
  * 2. At the //Enter an option [Show/Hide/Left/Right/Top/Bottom/Float] <Show>://, enter the toolbar name.
  * 3. Enter //AccuRender//.
  * 4. At the prompt //Enter an option [Show/Hide/Left/Right/Top/Bottom/Float] <Show>://, Enter to accept the default of Show.
  * 5. Your toolbar should now be floating. Repeat this for any additional toolbars you want to open.
To re-open //Docking Manager Windows//, do the following:

  * 1. At the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] command line type //-toolbar//.
  * 2. At the //Enter an option [Show/Hide/Left/Right/Top/Bottom/Float] <Show>://, enter the toolbar name.
  * 3. Enter //"Docking Manager Windows"// in double quotes for the space to work.
  * 4. At the prompt //Enter an option [Show/Hide/Left/Right/Top/Bottom/Float] <Show>://, Enter to accept the default of Show.
  * 5. Your toolbar should now be floating. Repeat this for any additional toolbars you want to open.

=====Method 2 - The Script=====

We can input all of this into a script file. Downloading the running the script will open all AccuRender 4 toolbars.

  * 1. Download [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/toolbars_ar4.zip|toolbars_ar4.zip]]
  * 2. Unzip the file //toolbars_ar4.zip// into //toolbars_ar4.scr// into any folder but remember where you are putting it!
  * 3. Open [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] and load Ar4.
  * 4. In AutoCAD, from the Tools menu, pick "Load Script" or type in the //Script// command.
  * 5. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the //toolbars_ar4.scr//. Double click on the //toolbars_ar4.scr// file.
  * 6. Watch your AccuRender 4 toolbars appear.

=====Method 3 - The Toolbar Button For Toolbar Gurus Only=====

If you do not know how to customize the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] toolbars, refer to your [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] Help. If you can make a button, you can do this.

  * 1. From the CUI command, make a new button.
  * 2. In the Properties for the new button, copy this into the Macro field (make sure to get all of it):
  ^C^C-toolbar;accurender;;-toolbar;render;;-toolbar;"docking manager windows";;-toolbar;file;;-toolbar;commands;;
  * 3. Save the button and copy it to a Toolbar. We recommend the Standard toolbar.
  * 4. Close the CUI.
  * 5. Pick your button and all the toolbars will open.
