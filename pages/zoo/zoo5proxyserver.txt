======Using Zoo 5 with a Proxy Server======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:zoo5|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses how to bypass a proxy server in order to access a local Zoo 5 Server.//

=====Overview=====
Many organizations today use proxies to protect their users from intrusion and to use smaller amounts of publicly routed IP addresses. A proxy is a server that sits between you and the Internet. It receives all client requests to the Internet, fulfills the request itself, and then sends the information to the client.

=====Bypassing a Proxy Server=====
There are instances where you would prefer to bypass the proxy and access the website or resource directly. A example is the locally available resource, like a Zoo 5 Sever, which is available through a direct network access.

Windows offers support for adding and configuring proxies inside Internet Explorer’s settings.

You can choose to enable the option **Bypass Proxy Server for local addresses** to bypass any local addresses by following these steps:

  - Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
  - Click Network and Internet, and then click Internet Options.
  - In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Connections tab.
  - Click the LAN Settings button.
  - Select the “Bypass proxy server for local addresses” checkbox.
  - Click OK to complete the proxy configuration process.
