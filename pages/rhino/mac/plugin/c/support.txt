Eventually. However, we are not yet ready to provide user support for C plug-ins, but we plan to do so in the future. You will have to recompile your plug-in using the Xcode development system. Depending on the complexity of your plug-in, it may take only a small amount of work to create a plug-in that compiles and works both on Windows and the Mac.
