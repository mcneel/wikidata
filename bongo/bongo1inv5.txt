**Are you getting the following error message:**

{{bongo:bongoregfixerror.png}}

**First thing to check - which version of Rhino 5 do you have installed?**
  * Bongo 1.0 is a 32-bit application, and therefore it won't install on 64-bit Rhino 5, so please make sure you have 32-bit Rhino 5 installed.

**Second thing to check**
  - Make sure you have latest version of 32-bit Rhino 5 installed. You can download the latest version from: http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5/latest
  - If having the latest version of 32-bit Rhino 5 installed and that doesn't solve the problem, please email McNeel technical support at tech@mcneel.com.
