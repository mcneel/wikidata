====== Rhino for Mac Work-In-Progress (WIP) ======

If you have purchased Rhino 5 for Mac, you have access to our Work-In-Progress (WIP) build: RhinoWIP.  These WIP builds are where we are testing out new code: new features, bug fixes, and other improvements.

The RhinoWIP build can be run side-by-side with the full, stable, commercial release...they are two separate applications:

__**RhinoWIP SHOULD NOT be used for mission-critical work as it may be unstable.**__

Rhinoceros (the full commercial release) and RhinoWIP have two separate update systems.  RhinoWIP will be updated more frequently than the stable, commercial release.

Rhinoceros and RhinoWIP do share preferences and a license.
