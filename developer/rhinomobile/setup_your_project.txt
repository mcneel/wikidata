======RhinoMobile - Setup Your Project======

Notes on the project architecture

  - In Xamarin Studio, create an empty Solution.  For our purposes, we'll call this //YourProjectMobile//, but you can call it whatever you like, as long as you follow the naming conventions.
  - Add a new project to the //YourProjectMobile// Solution.  Use C# Library project.  Call it //YourProject.Core//.  This creates an empty project that will be used as the template for the Cloned Project.
  - Add an Android C# Library Project called //YourProject.Core.Droid//.
  - Add a iOS C# Library Project called //YourProject.Core.Touch//.
  - In Finder, move the contents of //YourProject.Core.Droid// and //YourProject.Core.Touch// into the //YourProject.Core// folder.
  - In Xamarin Studio, remove (not delete) all the added projects.
  - In Xamarin Studio, Add Existing projects //YourProject.Core.Touch// and //YourProject.Core.Droid// (this time from their new home in //YourProject.Core// folder) to the Solution.
  - Delete //YourProject.Core.csproj//.
