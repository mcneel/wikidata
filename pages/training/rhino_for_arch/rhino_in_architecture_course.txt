===== Target Audience =====
  * This training is for creative designers working in architecture, digital fabrication, and other building related fields, as well as students in these fields.

===== Course Outline =====
This intensive 6-day class will focus on architectural workflows using Rhinoceros. It will introduce the best practices to maximize productivity and use the rich set of functionality supported by Rhino. It will cover various scenarios for concept modeling and detailed design and visualization. Topics include:

==== Topics ====
  * Modeling methods in architecture: Rhino supports direct and intuitive design to create a wide range of forms and details. Discuss the general approach and how it compares to other modeling methods.
  * Modeling vocabulary: best practices to work productively within the Rhino environment. Introduce topics such as interface, navigation, modeling constraint, visualization and data management.
  * Modeling workflows in architecture: the bulk of the training walks through a few modeling workflows common in architectural design, both in concept design development and detailed modeling.

==== Expected Outcome ====
After this course, the student is expected to be able to:
  * Learn the Rhino modeling environment and different ways to customize it.
  * Learn the Rhino modeling vocabulary and best practices for productivity.
  * Learn modeling workflows in both concept and detailed design.
