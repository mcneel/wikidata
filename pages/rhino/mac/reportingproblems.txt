==== Sending a large file to us ====

If you have a small file that would help us find a problem, you can attach it to the post to the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/category/rhino-for-mac|Discourse forum]].\\

If your file is very large
  - Go to the [[http://www.rhino3d.com/upload|McNeel File Upload]] web page. 
  - Enter your information and use **<tech@mcneel.com>** as the recipient address at McNeel, and be verbose in your description of your problem.

==== How to write a great bug report ====
We want to fix the problems you see, but first we have to duplicate the problem. Writing a great bug report helps us do that. Include as much detail as possible, even if it seems obvious to you. A great bug report includes:

  - Each step you perform to reproduce the problem. When running commands, note whether you ran a command from the application, or typed a command. Be specific when describing the command you start.
  - What happened after each step.
  - What you wish happened instead. 
  - A model that demonstrates the problem.
  - A screenshot of the problem.
  - A description of your hardware and Rhino version:
    - Open the Rhino Preferences panel.
    - Select the **OpenGL** tab. This displays a description of your computer.
    - Click the **Copy to clipboard** button. This copies the contents of the tab to your clipboard.
    - Paste the copied computer description into the post.
  - Does this problem happen with every model, or just a certain model?  If the problem is with just some models, we will need a copy of your model to duplicate the problem.

Assume you are the //only// person having the problem.
