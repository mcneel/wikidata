===== Having problems installing Bongo 1 on Rhino 5 =====

**First thing to check - which version of Rhino 5 do you have installed?**
  * Bongo 1.0 is a 32-bit application, and therefore it won't install on 64-bit Rhino 5, so please make sure you have 32-bit Rhino 5 installed.

**Are you getting the following error message:**
