====== Idle Processor Plug-in ======
> **Summary:** //Rhino 4.0 Plug-in that runs commands when Rhino is inactive.//
> **Updated:** //November 20, 2008//

===== Notes =====
This plug-in is included in the [[http://download.rhino3d.com/rhino/5.0/wip/|Rhino 5.0 WIP]].

=====Description=====

The Idle Processor plug-in for Rhino 4.0 allows you to schedule commands to be run when Rhino has been inactive for a user-specified period.

For example, you could have Rhino automatically save your current document or start a time-consuming rendering.

This plug-in requries Rhino 4.0 SR4 or greater.

=====Installation=====

  - Copy **IdleProcessor.rhp** file your **<drive>:\Programs Files\[[rhino:rhinoceros|RhinoCeros]] 4.0\Plug-ins** folder.
  - Start Rhino.
  - Run **PluginManager** and click the install button. Browse to your **<drive>:\Programs Files\[[rhino:rhinoceros|RhinoCeros]] 4.0\Plug-ins** folder and select **IdleProcessor.rhp**.

=====Configuration=====

  - Run **IdleProcessor**.
  - Click "Enable idle processing".
  - Specify the "Elapsed time in seconds".
  - Specify the idle process "Commands to run". Note, anything you can enter into a toolbar button command, you can enter into this window.

=====Limitations=====
  * Currently, the Idle Processor plug-in only listens to command inactivity. That is, if the Idle Processor plug-in detects that you have not run a command for the user-specified period, then it will run the idle process commands. Panning, zooming or rotating a view will not reset the idle timer.
  * The idle process commands are only run once. That is, if your elapsed time is set for 300 seconds (5 minutes) and you have been away from your system for 30 minutes, the idle process commands will be run one time (after the first 5 minutes), not six times. To reset the idle timer, just run another command.

=====Sample Command 1: Render to a Window=====
_SetActiveViewport Perspective
_-RunScript (
pts = Rhino.ViewNearCorners(Rhino.CurrentView)

Rhino.Command "//RenderInWindow " //_

& Rhino.Pt2Str(pts(0),,True) _
& Rhino.Pt2Str(pts(2),,True)
)
