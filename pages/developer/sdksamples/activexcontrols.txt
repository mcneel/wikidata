===== Question =====
I am facing a critical problem regarding a C++ plug-in under Rhino: any ActiveX controls placed in a simple dialog box will crash Rhino. What can I do solve this?

===== Answer =====
ActiveX, or OLE, controls work in Rhino plug-ins, as plug-in are simply regular MFC DLLs. For more information on MFC DLLs, read [[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hw85e4bb(v=VS.80).aspx|MFC Technical Note 33]] and [[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ft1t4bbc(v=VS.80).aspx|MFC Technical Note 58]] for more information.

Also, you will need to call this function:

<code c++>
void AfxEnableControlContainer();
</code>

in your CWinApp-derived object's InitInstance() member to enable support for
containment of OLE controls.
