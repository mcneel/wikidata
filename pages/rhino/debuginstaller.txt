====== Debugging Installer Errors ======

> **Summary:** //Instructions for generating a log file from a .MSI installer (such as Rhino 4.0, 5.0, Flamingo 2.0, Brazil 2.0)//

=====Problem=====
When I try to install the product, I get an installer error and the install does not complete.

=====Solution=====
Follow the procedure below to generate a text file which is a log of the actions that happen during the install, and then email the text file to McNeel Technical Support <tech@mcneel.com>

=====Procedure=====
  * Download this zip file http://s3.amazonaws.com/mcneel/misc/DebugInstaller.zip
  * Unzip the file inside named "DebugInstaller.exe" to your desktop.
  * If you are installing from a downloaded file, follow these instructions to  [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/rhino5/manual_extract_from_file|uncompress the Downloaded Rhino 5 EXE into a folder.]]
  * Find the MSI installer. The location is different for different products:

    Rhinoceros 4.0 CD -- Name is "Rhino4_Setup.msi" in the Rhinoceros folder on the CD
    Rhinoceros 4.0 Evaluation -- Unzip the .EXE installer (like rh40eval_en_yyyymmdd.exe) and find the file "RHINO4_EVALUATION_EN.MSI"
    Rhinoceros 5.0 WIP/Beta -- Name is "rh50beta_x86_en_yyyymmdd_hhmm.msi"
    Flamingo 2.0 CD -- Name is "Flamingo2_Setup_English.msi" in the Flamingo folder on the CD
    Flamingo 2.0 Evaluation -- Unzip the .EXE installer (like fl20eval_en_yyyymmdd.exe) and find the file "FL20_.MSI"
    Brazil 2.0 CD -- Name is "Setup Brazil.msi" in the Brazil folder on the CD
    Brazil 2.0 Evaluation -- Unzip the .EXE installer (like brazil_evaluation_yyyymmdd.exe) and find the file "BRAZIL_2.0_ENGLISH.MSI"

  * Run **DebugInstaller.exe** by double-clicking on it on the desktop.
  * Drag the installer .MSI file onto the window with the title **McNeel Install Debugger**.
  * The install process will start. Proceed forward until the error is encountered and continue until the installer stops.
  * On your desktop find the new .txt file named the same as the .MSI installer file but with the extension .txt (example: Rhino4_Setup.txt). The icon looks like a spiral-bound notepad. The file extension may not show.
  * Email that .txt file to McNeel Technical Support at <tech@mcneel.com>
