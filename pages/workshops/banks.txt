===== Banks High School =====
This an in-depth, hands-on, three-day workshop. Rhino educational resources like Rhino in Education posts, Rhino Curriculum Guide, expertise from the instructors & fellow teachers will guide us during this workshop. 
A major goal of the workshop is to get your students working in 3d with Rhino on day-one in your classes. 

Participants should be able to develop skills and projects that fit the output tools available in their own labs. The instructors and host teacher have years of classroom knowledge and expertise.  The output tools available will be different at each teaching lab; not all labs will have the same devices.
 
We need to remember the reason for the workshop is to practice working with Rhino and gaining skills, strategies, and knowledge for the classroom.  Bring a blank Flash Drive so you can take models, projects, and information back with you.  

The shop room has 27 Windows computers with Rhino 6 installed. Teachers will have access to For fabrication equipment we have a laser cutter/engraver, CNC plasma, vinyl cutter w/heat press, CNC router, & several 3D printers.

There will be paper, metal, wood, plywood, vinyl, etc. that can be used in fabrication projects. Teachers are welcome to bring their own .125"  and .25" thick wood and plywood, also cardboard and vinyl.

There are a couple of places in Banks for lunch or teachers can bring a sack lunch.

Classroom is in the 'Vocational Building' at the north end of the school. There is a blue door that will be open that faces Main St, where there is some parking, and there is a parking lot that faces the football scoreboard where sliding doors of the shop will be open. Look for signs off Main St.
