====== Setting Up A Material Library for AccuRender nXt======
  * AccuRender nXt does not keep materials in a single library file. 
  * AccuRender nXt stores each material in tis own unique file. 
  * When you use a material, it gets copied to the model and stored there. 
  * The model does not reference the nXtmaterial file in the folder or link to it.
  * The model references the copy of the material definition stored in each model.
  * This was one of the improvements or changes to nXt. The advantage is if you move the model to another machine or give it to a customer, the materials are there!

  - Downlaod the material library "Ar4 Legacy Library" in zip from [[http://www.accurender.com/page/material-libraries|here:]]
  - On **Vista** or **Windows 7**, create a subfolder called **Ar4_Materials** under **c:\ProgramData**. 
  - On **XP**, create a subfolder called **Ar4_Materials** under **C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data**. //(If you do note see this folder on your XP system, go to File Explorer –> Tools –> Folder Options –> View tab –> select “Show Hidden Files and Folders.)//
  - Unzip the **Ar4MaterialLib.zip** in the folder you create above. This zip will generate a series of folders whose structure mimics the legacy Ar4 material library.
  - After setting up these folders, you can browser for the materials. 

Here are two additional tips:
  * When you browse for the material files, change the file View to //**thumbnail**//, so you can preview the material. {{:accurender:nxt:arnxt_material_folder_small.jpg|}}

  * You can “//drag and drop//” the materials directly from the File Explorer window onto AutoCAD model geometry, without going through the nXt Conrol Panel. You will be asked to assign by layer or directly to the object.
