====== AccuRender 4.0 with Windows 7 32-Bit ======

Currently, AccuRender 4 is not supported when installed on [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2010 or [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] [[rhino:architecture|Architecture]] 2010 on Windows 7 32-Bit.

This is a complex problem and AR4 is considered old technology for these newer operating systems. [[http://nxt.accurender.com/|AccuRender nXt]] may give you some relief, but it is still under development.

However, the best approach may be to get back to supported territory by running XP 32-Bit or Vista 32-Bit until AccuRender nXt ships.

Equally as important, Autodesk is only supporting [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2010 products on Windows 7. Any [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] prior to 2010 is not tested or supported on Windows 7. See this [[http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&id=14053691&linkID=9240897|Autodesk support article]]

If you want to take the "bailing wire" approach, the following steps are unofficial, but AccuRender 4 sr4 seems to run ok in preliminary tests.

This does not mean in a condition of limited resources that Ar4 will operate uninterrupted and error free. Use at your own risk and test on your computer before moving forward with any project.

  * When running on Windows 7 and [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2010 you will get the "file missing" error in the Content browser. **Do not uninstall Internet Explorer 8.** (If you already did, just re-enable it according the Microsoft directions.) Accurender became very unstable for us when we did. we got fatal errors every time we picked in the Content browser. IE7 would not install on Windows 7, it gave a not supported message. So we reinstalled IE8. AR4 immediately got stable again.
  * When trying to edit materials, materials in the user library were editable. However we still could not edit any of the AccuRender Libraries because of the path "spoofing" that Windows 7 does for security.
  * We got around this by coping the contents of **C:\Program Files\Common Files\McNeel Shared\AccuRender Libraries** to a folder **C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\AccuRender\Libraries** folder. Next we set the Default Library path in Options --> "AccuRender" --> Paths --> Advanced dialog to that folder.

  * Test: Open the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] application, and open an AccuRender sample file. The layers should find their assigned materials in the "Ar4 Tutorials" library. This should also eliminate the error "***Couldn't instantiate handler interface *** Failed to register. Creating new content...Done" when making the library additions or changes.
  * To edit materials: you can not use Ar4 Content Browser on Windows 7.  You need to use Materials Manager and highlight the layer and browse to the library.  Now you can copy/edit the materials. Or type AR3 and use the old AR3 control panel.
