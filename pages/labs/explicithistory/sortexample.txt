All data in Explicit History is stored in lists. Sometimes this data is stored in a predictable (sorted) fashion. Sometimes it is chaotic (unsorted). The Sort component allows you to sort up to four sets of data simultaneously. (This example only sorts two sets at the same time.)

Points by themselves cannot be sorted, but numbers can. This example sorts an unorganised set of points by creating a new list of distance values which acts as the key list. As the key list is sorted, the points are automatically shuffled in the same fashion.
