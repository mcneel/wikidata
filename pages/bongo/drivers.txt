====== "A required resource was unavailable" error message ======
Sometimes users with old display drivers see this error message when running a Bongo animation with Flamingo 2 in Rhino V4. Specifically, this happens in Rhino V4 SR7, on an Intel 82915G Express graphics card running driver version 6.14.10.3847 (2004). Update the driver version 14.25.50.4764 (2007) to fix the problem.

Keep your display drivers updated to the latest version to avoid those many strange and difficult problems.
