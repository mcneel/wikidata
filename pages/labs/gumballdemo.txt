===== Gumball Commands=====


  * **GumballGripOn**
    * This command makes a gumball that acts like a control point.
    * Example
       - Make a box, select it, and run "GumballGripOn".
        2. Use the gumball to move the object.
        3. Press the Escape key or run "PointsOff"
           to turn off the gumball grip.
    * If you want to use one gumball to move more than one object, then use the GumballTransform command.
  * **GumballTransform**
    * This command is similar other Rhino Transform commands, like Move or Rotate.  It uses a gumball interface to perform the transformation.
    * Example 1
       - Make three spheres, select all of them and
           run "GumTransform".
        2. Use the gumball to move the spheres.
        3. Press Enter to turn off the gumball.
    * Example 2
       - Make a curve, turn on its control points, select
           several control points, and run "GumTransform".
        2. Use the gumball to move the control points.
        3. Press Enter to turn off the gumball.

  * **GumballEdge**
    * This command is like gumball transform but it lets you move an edge that joins rectangular faces in a polysurface.
    * Example
       - Make a box, run "GumballEdge" and pick an edge
           of the box.
        2. Use the gumball to move the edge.
        3. Press Enter to turn off the gumball.

===== Moving the Gumball=====


The gumball has three types of transformation controls. To move the gumball, click, drag and release the controls. If you need to reposition the gumball without moving the objects it transforms, tap the CONTROL key while dragging a transformation control.
