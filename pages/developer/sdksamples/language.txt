====== Command Prompt Window Moves when Setting Language ======

=====Question=====
Iâ€™m trying to change the language of Rhino by code:

<code vb>
Dim settings As MRhinoAppSettings = RhUtil.RhinoApp.AppSettings
Dim appearance As IRhinoAppAppearanceSettings = settings.AppearanceSettings()
Dim appearance2 As New MRhinoAppAppearanceSettings(appearance)
appearance2.m_language_identifier = id_lang
settings.SetAppearanceSettings(appearance2)
</code>
This code works, but it change the position of the command prompt. When I have it on the botton, change it to the top. Do you know why?

=====Answer=====
When making a copy if Rhino's **CRhinoAppAppearanceSettings** object, in order to make changes, make sure the **sync_with_ui** argument is set to **True** when calling **CRhinoAppSettings::AppearanceSettings**. The following examples demonstrate this:

===== C++ =====
<code c++>
CRhinoCommand::result CCommandTest::RunCommand( const CRhinoCommandContext& context )
{
  CRhinoAppSettings& settings = RhinoApp().AppSettings();
  CRhinoAppAppearanceSettings appearance = settings.AppearanceSettings(true);
  appearance.m_language_identifier = 1034; // Spanish
  settings.SetAppearanceSettings(appearance);
  return CRhinoCommand::success;
}
</code>

===== C# =====
<code c#>
public override IRhinoCommand.result RunCommand(IRhinoCommandContext context)
{
  MRhinoAppSettings settings = RhUtil.RhinoApp().AppSettings();
  MRhinoAppAppearanceSettings appearance = new MRhinoAppAppearanceSettings(settings.AppearanceSettings(true));
  appearance.m_language_identifier = 1034; // Spanish
  settings.SetAppearanceSettings(appearance);
  return IRhinoCommand.result.success;
}
</code>
