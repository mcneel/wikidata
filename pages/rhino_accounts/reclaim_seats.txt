====== Reclaiming seats after removing a team member ======

Currently, if a team member is removed from a team, it may take a couple of days before Rhino tries to renew their lease and fails because they are no longer authorized to use a seat from the team. However, it's possible to manually speed up the process and immediately reclaim any seats currently in use by recently removed team members.

  - Go to the [[https://www.rhino3d.com/licenses|Licenses Portal]].
  - Click on the name of the team that you want to manage.
  - Scroll to the bottom and click //Manage Team > Void Unauthorized Leases…//.
  - Click //"Yes"//.
  - If Rhino is in use then the unauthorized user will see a //“You have been removed from the team ‘ABC’. Do you want to keep using Rhino here?”// message.

//**Note:** Only team owners and admins can perform this operation.//
