====== Region Select Sample ======
> **Version:** //Rhino 4//

=====What does this plugin do?=====

It is called RegionSelect and it will select all points and grips that lie visually within an enclosed region. Code is optimized, but not unreadable. Many comments added for your convenience and entertainment. RegionSelect differs from Lasso in the following ways:

\\

  * With RegionSelect you **cannot** draw a curved outline, only a polyline.
  * With RegionSelect you **can** specify an existing curve which serves as the outline.
  * RegionSelect is not bound to screen-pixel accuracy when evaluating inclusion.
  * RegionSelect is more easily scriptable since it accepts existing geometry.
  * RegionSelect can be up to 125 times faster than Lasso.

=====What can I expect to learn from thumbing through this?=====
Using a simple ObjectGetter with some extra options, creating MRhinoGetPoint derived classes, reading out viewport information, using GDI+ to draw Rhino geometry, fitting polylines through curves, perform fast inclusion testing, using the MRhinoObjectIterator, using OnXForms, converting geometry between different classes and a few things more.
