======No Network Driving Showing======

>Mapped network drives don't show in Rhino 5 file open dialog 

Several have reported that the Rhino 5 file dialog does not display mapped network drives in Windows 8/8.1. This is generally isolated to Matrix users running as Administrators with UAC disabled.

Under these conditions, a policy registry key called "EnableLinkedConnections” needs to be added that will enable the mapped drives to appear when running applications as an administrator.

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]
“EnableLinkedConnections”=dword:00000001

Thanks to Dale Fugier for figuring this out.\\
