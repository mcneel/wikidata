====== Working with Textures ======

With Textures you can map image files onto the surface of a material. There are three ways to do this.
  - For a simple texture mapping, go to //Materials → New Material → Textured...// You will be prompted to select an image to map to the surface of your material. If the image does not tile well, you can select **Mirror Tiles** to remove the seams. 
  - For a more sophisticated textured material, go to //Materials → New Material → Texture Set...// You can import third-party texture maps that contain information such as displacement, normal, or bump maps. Displacement maps cause the material to have depth, which comes at a performance cost. For the appearance of relief without this performance cost, use normal or bump maps.
  - For advanced options, either click the **Advanced...** button in the Texture Set dialog, or go to //Materials → New Material → Advanced...// and then click on the **Texture Maps** tab. This interface allows you to control more details, such as the height of the displacement mapping or which colors are masked. It also lets you add maps and manually set the map type, e.g. Standard or Displacement. 

Non-tiling textures can also be applied directly to objects, bypassing the material altogether, by using [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:decals|decals]].
