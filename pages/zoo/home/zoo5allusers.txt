====== Set the Zoo 5 for all users ======

> **Summary:** //The instruction of setting the Zoo 5 for all users on a Rhino client computer.//

===== Issue =====
I have several users on a Rhino client computer. I have to set the Zoo server IP/name in every user. Can I set the Zoo server once for all users?
\\
\\
===== Cause =====
When you use a double-click to run Rhino 5 and set the Zoo server, the Zoo server information is added to Windows Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER. **This is for the current user only.**
\\
\\
===== Solution =====
Right-click the Rhino 5 shortcut icon, select "Run as administrator" and set the Zoo server. The Zoo server information is added to Windows Registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. **This is for all users.** Users can use a double-click to run Rhino as usual in the future.
\\
\\
**Note:** Rhino 5 network node finds the Zoo server information under HKEY_CURRENT_USER first and then HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

**The full paths:**

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager
