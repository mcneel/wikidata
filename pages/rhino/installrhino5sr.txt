=====Question=====
I have a new computer and I want to install Rhino 5.  I have always purchased upgrade versions of Rhino.  Do I have to install **all** previous versions and successive service packs??

=====Answer=====
**No**, but you need both your **new Rhino 5 License Key** and the **License Key from your previous version** of Rhino.\\
  - [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5.0/latest|Download the latest Rhino 5 installer.]]
  - Run the installer using your Rhino 5 Upgrade license key.
  - During the installation, you are asked to enter the license key from your previous version of Rhino.
  - Complete the Registration and Validation of your new license.
