====== When will renderers work on Rhino for Mac? ======
> **Summary:** //Do plug-ins work on the Rhino for Mac version?//

Rhino 5 for Mac is released. Plug-ins are not supported...yet.

Two **big** things need to happen before plug-ins will be available for Rhino for Mac:

  - We provide plug-in authoring tools to third-party developers.
  - Third-party developers write their plug-ins for Rhino for Mac.

When will plug-ins be available in Rhino for Mac? Could be as soon as 5.1...but it depends (see 2 above).
