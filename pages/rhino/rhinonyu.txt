===== Course Outline =====

In this comprehensive 3-day class you'll learn to create and edit accurate 3-D
models. This fast-moving class covers most of Rhino's functionality, including the most advanced
surfacing commands.

===== Structure =====

In this class, you will systematically move through the user interface, command access, creation and
editing curves, surfaces and solids.

==== Expected Outcomes ====
After this course the student is expected to be able to:
  * Utilize the features of the Rhino user interface
  * Customize your modeling environment
  * Create basic graphic objects—lines, circles, arcs, curves, solids, and surfaces
  * Model with precision using coordinate input, object snaps, and SmartTrack™ tools
  * Modify curves and surfaces with edit commands and Gumball
  * Use control point editing to modify curves and surfaces
  * Analyze your model
  * Display any portion of the model
  * Export and import models to and from different file formats
  * Render the model using Rhino Render
  * 3D Print
  * Understand how to begin using Grasshopper

===== What to bring =====
A Windows or Mac computer with the latest Rhinoceros 5 (or Rhino Evaluation) installed, a mouse, and the desire to learn.

Previous drafting and modeling experience is helpful, but not required.
