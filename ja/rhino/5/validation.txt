======Rhino 5のライセンスバリデーション======
Rhino 5 introduces a new license validation system aimed to reduce the piracy of Rhino licenses. License validation associates your license with your e-mail address (or e-mail domain in the case of a Lab License) and, for upgrade licenses, your previous license key. 

The Rhino license agreement allows you to have Rhino installed simultaneously on multiple computers so long as the license is in use on only one computer at a time. The validation system allows you to install your license on multiple computers, so long as you validate your license with the same information each time.

===== Upgrading from Previous Versions =====
When you upgrade Rhino from a previous version, license validation will associate the license from your previous version of Rhino with the license you are upgrading to. A previous version license can only be used to upgrade one Rhino 5 license. For example, consider a company that owns four licenses of Rhino 4 and upgrades to Rhino 5. Each upgrade installation should be associated with a different Rhino 4 license for validation to succeed.

===== The Validation Process =====
After installing Rhino, you are given a 30-day grace period to complete the validation process.

Rhino will display the License Validation Wizard. Follow the instructions on screen to validate your license.

If you receive an error during license validation, please contact [[http://www.rhino3d.com/support|McNeel Technical Support]] for assistance. Please include the error description when you contact support.

===== Validating Offline =====
If your computer is not connected to the internet, the License Validation Wizard will give you instructions on how to validate using a web browser on another computer. The process looks like this:

  - Visit https://www.mcneel.com/validate/rhino/5
  - Enter your e-mail address and license key
  - If required, enter a license key for a previous version of Rhino
  - A validation code will be displayed
  - Print or write down your validation code
  - Return to the computer that does not have an internet connection
  - Start Rhino 5.
  - Enter your validation code in the Validation Wizard and click Next

Rhino will now be successfully validated offline.
