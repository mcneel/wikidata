======PanelingTools and Grasshopper ======

> **Summary:** //Examples that show how to go between [[labs:panelingtools|PanelingTools]] and Grasshopper 0.6//


These examples show how to select a paneling grid in Grasshopper and bake it back into the document in a way that makes it usable by [[labs:panelingtools|PanelingTools]] plug-in commands.


I must warn you that the examples bypass Grasshopper's logic of selection and baking. Use with care.  I suspect future versions of Grasshopper will allow a better integration of paneling functionality through either directly migrating paneling methods or allowing more robust and customizable selection and bake components. For questions please contact [[rajaa@mcneel.com|Rajaa Issa]].

**Example 2**

Create a grid of points using Grasshopper components, then bake the grid to document.  Use ptOrientToGrid to panel the new grid with custom component. //[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/PT_BakeCurvePoints.zip|Download sample.]]//

**Example 3**

Select a paneling grid, move points randomly in z direction, then bake the grid back into the document.  Use ptPanelGrid and ptPanelGridCustom to panel the new grid. //[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/PT_Select_and_Bake.zip|Download sample.]]//
