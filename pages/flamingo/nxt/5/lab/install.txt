====== How to install Flamingo nXt 5 in a School Classroom or Lab ======

> **Summary:** //Flamingo's RHI installer is quick and easy.  But it is not clear how to easily install it on multiple computers in a lab.//


=====Installing Flamingo for Rhino 5=====
**//Problem://** The Flamingo nXt 5 uses the RHI Rhino's plugin installer engine (RHI). This makes most installations very quick and easy, although RHI installers can be more of a challenge on larger lab installations.

**//Answer://** 
Copying files in the correct locations through a default machine image, batch files or other deployment methods can finish Flamingo installations remotely.

There is a simple four-step process. Details are following:

  - Make sure [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5.0/sr|Rhino 5.12]] or newer has been deployed on your network using [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/home|the Zoo]].
  - Install the Flamingo RHI installer on each machine.
  - Copy the Flamingo Zoo License file into the Rhino license folder on each machine.
  - Install the thumbnail shell extension to allow material previewing.

Once the user starts up Rhino, Flamingo will load and complete the installation, that is automatic and needs no assistance.

==== Installing Flamingo silently for all users ====

The RHI installer can be individually installed on each machine, or through a command:

    
<code>"C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System\x64\rhiexec.exe" "C:\Full\Path\To\Flamingo5_Release_xxxxxxxx_xxxx.rhi" /admin /silent</code>


The /admin option installs for all users on the computer.
The /silent option will install without showing user int
The "xxxxxxxxx_xxxx" written in the above code, is the date and time of the file.  This will vary depending on the file you download.

==== Copying a Zoo license file for Flamingo onto the client ====

  - Download the [[http://d22oc15na41ks6.cloudfront.net/flamingo/nxt/5.0/license/fd53f8c4-546d-47d1-8820-e66c97645a97.lic|Flamingo License file (fd53f8c4-546d-47d1-8820-e66c97645a97.lic)]]
  - Navigate to the the following folder:

  C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager\Licenses

> **Note:** //By default, Microsoft has hidden the ProgramData folder. You can either use **Folder Options** to allow display of hidden files and folders, or you can type **%ProgramData%** in the address bar in Windows Explorer to navigate to it.//

==== Install the correct Flamingo Shell Extension on the client machine ====

Download and install the proper shell extension installer based on the operating system running on the client:

  - [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.na.mcneel.com/flamingo/nxt/5.0/shell_extensions/ArMatThumb64.exe|Flamingo Shell Extension Installer for 64-bit Windows]]
  - [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.na.mcneel.com/flamingo/nxt/5.0/shell_extensions/ArMatThumb.exe|Flamingo Shell Extension Installer for 32-bit Windows]]

Create a "Shell Extension" folder in the "C:\Program Files\Common Files\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\Plug-ins\Flamingo nXt 5.0 (fd53f8c4-546d-47d1-8820-e66c97645a97)" folder, copy the installer to the "Shell Extension" folder and run it.

After these steps, Flamingo will be ready to use on the client computers. There will still be some user profile specific configuration at the first startup of Flamingo, but that will be automatic.
