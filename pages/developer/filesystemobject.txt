====== RhinoScript and the FileSystemObject ======
> **Developer:** //[[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]]//
> **Summary:** //Where to find information on Scripting's FileSystemObject.//

When writing RhinoScripts, it may be important to add, move, change, create, or delete folders (directories) and files on your computer or on a network file server. It may also be necessary to get information about and manipulate drives attached to the file server. All of this can be done with the FileSystemObject, which is part of Microsoft's Scripting Runtime.

See http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hww8txat.aspx for the Scripting.FileSystemObject reference.
