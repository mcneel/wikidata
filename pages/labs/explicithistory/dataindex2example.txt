When accessing individual items in a list, you have to use an index value. The first item in any list is always stored at location zero, the second item at location 1, and so on. Typically, if you start to access a list at index -5, an error wil occur since no such location exists. However, some components that deal with indices have a Cycle option that remaps any index values onto the valid domain.


This example shows how Cycle on/off behaves differently.
