===== Display Troubleshooting: NVIDIA =====


**Update your video driver**
  - Close Rhino.
  - Get updated video drivers.
    - **Desktop**: [[http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us|Go to the NVIDIA site]].
    - **Laptop**: Get updated drivers from the laptop maker's Web site
  - Select the **graphics card** make and model and the **Windows operating system** you're using.
  - **Download** the suggested driver **installer**. We find the 340.66 or later is prefered.
  - **Run** the installer.
  - At the point where you can **choose installation type**, select “Custom (Advanced)”
  - On the next install screen **CHECK the option** that says “Perform a clean install”
  - Continue with the install
  - **Restart** (even though the installer might not suggest it).
  - **Open Rhino** to test if your issue has been fixed.
