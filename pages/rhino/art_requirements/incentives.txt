====== Incentives and Expected Practical Outcomes an ART Authorization ======
An [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/art_requirements|ART authorization]] is not necessary to teach Rhino. In 1999, customers and teachers asked McNeel to come up with a way to authorize individual Rhino trainers for their Rhino knowledge and ability to teach Rhino. This includes familiarity with Rhino resources, support forum and other materials. The ART and ARTC authorizations were established in 2000.

There are basic [[https://www.rhino3d.com/art|ART requirements]], however your region may require [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/art_requirements|additional qualifications.]] 

  * When you have completed the requirements and submitted your ART application, your application will be reviewed by McNeel staff. You will be officially notified of your authorization and you will receive instructions for the private **MyMcNeel** portal. 


  * **MyMcNeel** is an account login associated with [[http://accounts.rhino3d.com|Rhino Accounts]] which will allow you to post your classes and registration links to our Rhino training site. //Only ART/ARTC can post their classes to our main Learn page and will be listed as offering custom training. 
//

  * Some potential students may ask if you are an authorized ART.

  * You may add your new ART to your LinkedIn and your list of other commercial certifications and authorizations. 

  * Some employers require it for in-house Rhino training. 

  * Marketing and technical support staff are asked questions daily about training. A training newsletter is also published each month that highlights the upcoming classes by ARTs and ARTCs on the Rhino schedule. If requested, we'll also publish Rhino News Blogs posts for any special training that you may have scheduled. 

  * McNeel typically does not present regularly scheduled Level 1 & Level 2 training. Our ARTs and ARTC offer that training, mostly online.

  * You may ask for opinions of other users, recommendations or "testimonies" on the [[https://discourse.mcneel.com/|Rhino Support Forum]]. We also get feedback from our ARTs that this authorization adds value and brings attention to their preparedness to teach Rhino.

In summary, individuals wanting to teach Rhino do not have to be an ART, however ART authorization is required if you would like to post your Rhino classes on the **[[https://www.rhino3d.com/training/United_States/|Learn]]** page of our [[http://www.rhino3d.com|Rhino web site]].
