=====Understanding Usage Statistics=====

Usage statistics help us prioritize the features and improvements we should work on. 

Usage statistics contain information such as preferences, feature use, file types used, operating system version, and memory use. A random number is stored on your computer and is sent with each report. This allows us to differentiate between one person experiencing a problem 100 times, and 100 people each experiencing a problem once. This number is not used to identify you. 

Rhino does not collect geometry or other data in files you create or open. Usage statistics do not contain information that allows us to reproduce geometry you create. 

====To Enable or Disable Usage Statistics:====
    - From the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
    - In the **Updates and Statistics** tab, select or clear the **Enable automatic updates and usage statistics** checkbox.
    - Enter your e-mail address in the **Send my e-mail address with usage statistics field** to send it with statistics from your computer. McNeel may e-mail you to learn more about how you use Rhino.
