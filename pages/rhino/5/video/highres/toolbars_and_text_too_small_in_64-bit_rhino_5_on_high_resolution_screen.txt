======Toolbars and Text Too Small on High Resolution Monitors======

> **Summary:** //The 64-bit Rhino 5 user interface was not designed for the new Ultra High Definition, High DPI, or High Resolution displays. These are the details needed to make Windows automatic display scaling work correctly to fix the issue.//


=====What needs to be done?=====
  * Add a System Registry key (Requires local Administrator rights)
  * Copy a file into the Rhino System folder


=====What are the details?=====
  - Download this file: {{:rhino:5:video:highres:RhinoHiRes.zip|}}
  - Unzip RhinoHiRes.zip onto your Desktop. It will create two files: Rhino.exe.manifest and RhinoHiRes.reg
  - Right-mouse click on **RhinoHiRes.reg** and choose **Merge** to add the new key to your registry. You will be asked a couple questions. Note: The REG file creates the following key: ''[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SideBySide]
"PreferExternalManifest"=dword:00000001''
  - Copy **Rhino.exe.manifest** to: ''C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System\''
  - Start Rhino.

==Or, is the Rhino UI suddenly shrinking after using a file dialog?==
