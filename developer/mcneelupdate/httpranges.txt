====== McNeel Update: HTTP 1.1 Ranges Header ======
The McNeel Update service downloads both version.xml files and installers using the [[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732428.aspx|Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)]]. This service is used by the Windows Update system, and allows silent background downloads that cannot be blocked by firewalls.

Because BITS is designed to stop downloading when network usage is high, and to resume downloads later, it must be able to get specific parts of a file from the server. This is accomplished by sending the Range header in the HTTP request. The HTTP Range header specifies to the HTTP server a range of bytes to be sent in the response.

By default, dynamically rendered web pages do not support the HTTP Range header. However, it is possible to write code that supports it. For an example in PHP, see  [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/157318|this stackoverflow]] article.
