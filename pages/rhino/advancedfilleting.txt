====== Advanced Filleting ======
> **Summary:** //There are situations where the automatic filleting tools in Rhino may fail. This page contains tutorials that show how to manually get the desired results.//

The two primary commands for filleting surfaces in Rhino are:

====FilletEdge====
  * Creates a tangent surface between multiple polysurface edges (joined) with optional varying radius. values, trims the original faces, and joins the resulting surfaces together.
  * Is not limited to just two surfaces.
  * Can fill in corners between adjacent fillets.
  * Is limited to exactly three surfaces meeting at a point. (V4 only. V5 handles multiple surfaces at a single point.)
  * The radiuses used can not be so large that they overlap each other and completely consume any surface they are following.

====FilletSrf====
  * Creates a tangent surface between two surface edges (joined or not) with a constant radius, and optionally trims and extends the original surfaces.
  * Works on exactly two surfaces at a time
  * Does not fill in corners between adjacent fillets
