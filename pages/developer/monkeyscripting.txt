======Adding Plug-in RhinoScript to Monkey======
> **Developer:** //[[developer:cplusplusplugins|C++]]//
> **Summary:** //Demonstrates how to add your plug-in RhinoScript support to the Monkey editor tree//

If your plug-in extends the [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] scripting, then you can add it to [[developer:monkeyforrhino4|Monkey RhinoScript Editor.]]

  * Create a .syntaxml description file that includes your plug-in methods.
  * Compile and save the .syntaxml file in the //Monkey\Resources// directory.

=====Details=====

To create the description file, use the **MonkeySyntaxTreeEditor** command.

Be sure to increase the version number when you make a change or Monkey won't realize it has to recreate the dll caches.

Here is how to create your plug-in syntax tree that you can use from within Monkey:

1.) Click the New icon. This creates a new tree.  The name of the tree should match the name of your plug-in.

2.) Add your functions and define parameters and return values. You can also type a signature string in the property box directly. Monkey will attempt to parse the signature. So, if you type something like:

<code vb>
  AddGeometry(intType, blnRedraw, dblSize) as RhObject
</code>

will be properly parsed into:

<code vb>
  AddGeometry(ByVal intType As Integer, ByVal blnRedraw As Boolean, ByVal dblSize As Double) As RhObject
</code>

You can make minor adjustments inside this signature string as well, such as replacing "ByVal" with "ByRef" or changing parameter types.

3.) When done, compile, then save in Monkey resources folder.
