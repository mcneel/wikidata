====== Ar4 and RAM Memory. ======

AccuRender 4 uses a maximum of 2GB of virtual memory space when running on a 32 bit Windows XP, XP x64, and 32-bit Vista. It will use 3GB if the 3GB switch is set in the boot.ini.

It will use 3GB on Windows Vista x64 running as a 32 bit application without any boot.ini changes, 3GB of address space should be available automatically in that case.
