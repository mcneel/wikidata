====== The Texture Maps Tab ======

The Texture Maps tab contains several options for altering [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:textures|textures,]] as well as an ordered list of the maps being used. The controls for adding and removing maps, as well as re-ordering them, are at the top of this list.

The four tabs below the map list are:
  * **Main.** Controls for the tiling scale, replacing the current map, and changing the map type. There are additional controls, depending on the choice of map type. For standard maps, you can set Strength (how clear the texture is) and Bump, which uses the map's gradient to create the appearance of depth. Normal maps only have a bump control. For displacement maps, you can alter height, facet size, and z-offset.
  * **Masking.** By default, the alpha channel is masked. By selecting **Color** instead of **Alpha**, it is possible to mask any RGB value. The Transparent checkbox sets the masked color to transparent. The Reverse checkbox masks everything but the masked color. Blur determines the magnitude of partial masking around the masked color. Sensitivity measures the size of the area around the color that is also masked.
  * **Channels.** The controls for channel manipulation. Invert Channels switches RGB values, so dark becomes light, blue becomes orange, etc. The Color checkbox turns all colors on and off. Specular Intensity makes the material more reflective and mirror-like. Specular Color blends the highlight color (under the Main tab of the material editor) and the texture map's color for specular reflections.
  * **Orientation.** Rotation rotates the tiles. Offset X and Y move the tiles around on the surface of the material.
