Shift + Alt + RMB

  * In V4, doing this with the cursor at the edges of the viewport will constrain the rotation in 5 degree increments

======Zooming======

=====Zoom - Keeping target in the same plane=====
 Note: The target will not stay in the exact location, it will stay in the same plane perpendicular to the camera, however it's position on that plane will change depending where the cursor is located during the zoom

MMW

CTRL + RMB

  * If you are using this method in a perspective viewport, you will find that as you zoom further and further in, you will eventually start to run into your target, which gives the appearance of not being able to zoom in any further. To correct this use [[rhino:placetarget|Place Target]]

=====Zoom - Moving the target with camera=====
