~ Extract Mesh Outline works for polysurfaces and multiple polysurfaces! It even works for selections of meshes and polysurfaces! YAY! [Andrew - 20051030]
~ MeshOutline works great, thanks. For several cases better then silhouette,when you want only the outline. [Erik - 20051030]
~ Ah, OK, I didn't see this in the Mesh menu. It does only create a polyline (as it's working on the meshes of the [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] objects, not on the objects themselves), but might be useful in many cases, and if your mesh is fine enough you could convert the thing into real curves with a bit of work. Still hope that Silhouette will work correctly one day, as we have been waiting for this since V1... [Mitch - 20051030]
