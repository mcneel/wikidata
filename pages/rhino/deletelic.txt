====== Rhino 5 Validation Fails - Even After Reset ======
If validation fails with message about invalid email, please call [[http://www.rhino3d.com/sales|McNeel Sales]] in your region. (US 206-545-7000).

If validation fails even after Sales has reset your license, or you are prompted to enter an upgrade key and you do not have an upgrade, it is possible that you accidentally typed in your Rhino 5 License Key incorrectly.
You can fix this, but you will need to delete the LIC file.

===== Method 1 =====
  - Close Rhino
  - Delete the LIC file in the //C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager\Licenses\// folder. This file will be similar to 12456787-8f7f-41da-801d-1c87e32f88f5.lic
  - Start Rhino 5.
  - Enter your license key again.

===== Method 2 =====
  - Download [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/mcneel/rhino/5.0/DeleteRhinoLicense/DeleteRhinoLicense.exe|DeleteRhinoLicense.exe]] on to your Deskop.
  - Run **DeleteRhinoLicense** on your computer.
  - Reopen Rhino 5.
