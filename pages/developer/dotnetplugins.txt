[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/developer/dotnetplugins|{{:developer:rhino_plugin.png?128|Rhino.NET}}]]

><color red>**Warning:**</color> Rhino.NET will **not** be available in Rhino 6. **Use [[rhinocommon|RhinoCommon]] if possible.** 
>[[rhinocommon|RhinoCommon]] is the new .NET plug-in SDK for Rhino 5.

The Rhino.NET SDK is designed for .NET developers to create Rhino plug-ins with the same capabilities as Rhino C++ SDK developers.


=====.NET framework plug-in development (Rhino 4 and 5)=====
Rhino ships with the necessary components to enable Rhino.NET plug-ins on users' computers. Plug-ins can be created with a compiler that compiles assemblies using .NET 2.0, including:

  * Microsoft Visual C# and Microsoft Visual VB.NET 2005 and 2008 (including [[http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express|Microsoft Visual Studio Express editions]])
  * Microsoft Visual C# and Microsoft Visual VB.NET 2010, supported on Rhino 5
  * SharpDevelop 2.0 and above

=====What is the Rhino.NET SDK?=====
Rhino.Net SDK helps developers extend Rhino's functionality  using Rhino plug-ins. The Rhino.NET SDK provides the tools to develop Rhino plug-ins using a .NET programming language. This means that Rhino plug-ins can now be developed using VB.NET, C#, C++.NET, Delphi.NET (and the list goes on).

The Rhino.NET SDK is actually a wrapper around the Rhino C++ SDK. Most of the classes and methods provided by the C++ SDK are available through .NET.

=====Where is the Rhino.NET SDK?=====
The Rhino.NET SDK an assembly named Rhino_DotNET.dll located in the Rhino system directory. The Rhino_DotNET.dll assembly is what all Rhino.NET plug-ins reference to get exported classes and functions from Rhino. This file is installed with Rhino and is not a separate download.
