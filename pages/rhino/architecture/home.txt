===Computational Design===
Rhino and especially Grasshopper have lead in the revolution of computational design in Architecture and fabrication.

==Learning Grasshopper==
 
----
===Using Rhino for Topography===
Rhino can be used to create topographic maps. The difficult part of the process is understanding the information you have to start and how to massage that information to get to a Topo.

  * Getting topo from Google Earth
  * Creating a topo from Points
  * Creating a topo from Curves
  * Creating a topo From Survey information.
  * Creating a topo from a mesh.

the series of publications by the emtech at the AA school http://www.emtechlog.net/2007/04/published_books_and_magazines/
most of the work exhbited here: http://scriptedbypurpose.wordpress.com/ (was curated by skylar tibbits marc fornes of theverymany as mentioned above)
Kostas Terzidis was also on the Advisory Committee of the critical digital conference: http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k23421
Manuel de Landa is also worth reading. Deleuze and the Use of the Genetic Algorithm in Architecture
I found this website really usefull for computanional Theory really interesting. You can download all the publication in PDF format. Enjoy!!!! http://jeneratiff.com/doku.php?id=publications
Also, a very good book : http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Training/Books/Architectural+Geometry.htm
I have uploaded my graduate thesis publication on parametric modeling here: http://www.davismarques.com/share/DavisMarques-FederationModeler.pdf The thesis deals with change management strategies for complex design projects. It draws on systems theory and cognitive models of designer behavior. The outcome was a prototype parametric modeling system, similar in many respects to Grasshopper and GenerativeComponents.
in general the writings of Patrik Schumacher are quite useful for understanding an approach towards advanced digital design methods.
