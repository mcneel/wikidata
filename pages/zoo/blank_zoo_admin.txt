==== Background ====

The **Zoo Admin Application** utilizes WPF as its GUI library.

A WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application can run on a machine without a physical monitor, but it might not be visible or functional in the same way as when a monitor is connected. WPF applications primarily rely on a visual display, and without a monitor, it can't render their UI elements.

If WPF can’t initialize the display & all the display details so it fails.
“Headless” computer setup with the Lan Zoo may display a blank dialog.

==== Workaround: ====
Remote on the headless Zoo server with MS RDP ([[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/understanding-remote-desktop-protocol|Remote Desktop Protocol]]) from another workstation. 
It appears that RDP provides what WPF needs & can display the dialog.
