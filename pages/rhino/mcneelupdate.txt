====== The McNeel Update System ======
The McNeel Update system is installed with Rhino 5. It periodically checks with our servers to see if new builds of Rhino and other related plug-ins are available.

==== I didn't get an update! ====
If you are not getting automatic updates, but think that you should be, please do the following:

  - Download the [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/mcneel/misc/McNeelUpdateLogZipper.zip|McNeelUpdateLogZipper]].
  - Run the McNeelUpdateLogZipper.
  - Email the resulting Zip file to [[tech@mcneel.com|us]] for review. 
 
We'll let you know why the update didn't work.
