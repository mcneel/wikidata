====== Rhino 8 Mac with Enscape Reporting "License Not Found" ======
Rhino 8 Mac with Enscape installed, sometimes reports "License not found" error and will not open.

This happens may happen because Rhino was not initialized  be Enscape was install and Enscape created ~/Library/Application Support/McNeel with wrong permissions.

The "fix" is to remove Enscape and all supporting files and then re-install and run Rhino **first** before re-installing Enscape.
 
  - Restart your Mac.
  - Make sure Rhino 8 is not running.
  - Launch Terminal.
  - rm -rf /Users/Shared/McNeel and press enter.
  - Remove the folders that Enscape created.
  - (a) If Rhino 7 is installed and working and you only want to fix Rhino 8, run rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0
  - (b)Otherwise, run rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel
  - Start Rhino 8
  - With Rhino successfully starting, now you can reinstall Enscape
