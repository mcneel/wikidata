Domain Linked Teams
For easier administration of larger teams, accounts linked through a domain can be set up. Anybody with an email address matching that domain can automatically join your domain-linked team and have access to your licenses - no invitation email verification is required. Domain-linked teams support custom authentication providers (Google, Active Directory, or One Login) to keep your user management centralized. Link your team to a domain.
