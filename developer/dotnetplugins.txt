[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/developer/dotnetplugins|{{:developer:rhino_plugin.png?128|Rhino.NET}}]]

>**NOTE:** [[rhinocommon|RhinoCommon]] is the new .NET plug-in SDK for Rhino 5.
>Rhino.NET will NOT be available in Rhino 6. Use RhinoCommon if possible

=====.NET Framework Plug-In Development (Rhino 4 and 5)=====
Rhino ships with the necessary components to enable Rhino.NET plug-ins on users computers. Plug-ins can be created with a compiler that compiles assemblies using .NET 2.0, including:

  * Microsoft Visual C# and Microsoft Visual VB.NET 2005 and 2008 (including [[http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express|Microsoft Visual Studio Express editions]])
  * Microsoft Visual C# and Microsoft Visual VB.NET 2010 are supported on Rhino 5
  * SharpDevelop 2.0 and above

=====Downloads=====

=====What is the Rhino.NET SDK?=====
Rhino.Net SDK helps developers to extend Rhino's functionality  using  'Rhino plug-ins'. The Rhino.NET SDK provides the tools to develop Rhino plug-ins using a .NET programming language. This means that Rhino plug-ins can now be developed using VB.NET, C#, C++.NET, Delphi.NET (and the list goes on).

The Rhino.NET SDK is actually a wrapper around the Rhino C++ SDK. Most of the classes and methods provided by the C++ SDK are available through .NET.

=====Where is the Rhino.NET SDK?=====
The Rhino.NET SDK is composed of a rhino plug-in named RhinoDotNetManager.rhp and an assembly named Rhino_DotNET.dll located in the Rhino system directory. The Rhino_DotNET.dll assembly is what all Rhino.NET plug-ins reference to get exported classes and functions from Rhino. These files are installed with Rhino and are not a separate download.

=====What can I do with the Rhino.NET SDK?=====
The Rhino.NET SDK is designed to allow .NET developers to create Rhino plug-ins with the same capabilities as Rhino C++ SDK developers.
