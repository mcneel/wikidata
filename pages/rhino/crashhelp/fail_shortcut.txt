=== Rhino won't start from a desktop or Start menu shortcut ===
  * **Start in SafeMode**.
    * SafeMode starts Rhino without using accelerated graphics and without loading plug-ins
    * On the **Windows Start Menu**, click the item
      * **Rhinoceros 5.0 in Safe Mode** or 
      * **Rhinoceros 5.0 (64-bit) in Safe Mode**
      * Answer **Yes** to loading **Toolbars** and **No** to loading RDK.

  * If **Rhino starts in SafeMode**, there is likely a problem with a **video driver** or a **plug-in**.
    * In the Rhino menu: **Tools - Options - View - OpenGL**, **Uncheck** the box at the top labeled **Use accelerated hardware modes**. 
    * Close Rhino and start normally (not using SafeMode). 

    * If **Rhino starts with accelerated hardware disabled**, the problem is likely your **video card driver**. 
      * **Download and install a current driver** for your video card. Its best to get your driver update from your hardware manufacturer and not from a third-party site.
        * nVidia:  http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx
        * Intel:   http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Default.aspx
        * ATI/AMD: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx
        * Apple:   http://support.apple.com/downloads/#bootcamp
        * Other site appropriate to your video hardware
        * Note: If you're on a laptop, you'll probably have to get your driver update from the laptop maker.
      * Restart Rhino normally (not using SafeMode).

    * If **Rhino still crashes after disabling hardware acceleration**, the problem may be a **plug-in**.
      * **Restart in SafeMode**, and **Check** the box for **Use accelerated hardware modes**. 
      * In the Rhino menu: **Tools - Options - Plug-ins**, **Uncheck** the **Enabled** box for all of the plug-ins that did not ship with Rhino, and **Check** the box **Ask to load disabled plug-ins** at the bottom.
      * Close Rhino and start normally (not using SafeMode). 
        * **Answer No** to loading all of the plug-ins you disabled.

      * If **Rhino starts with some plug-ins disabled**, the problem is one of the disabled plug-ins. 
        * **Restart Rhino normally** and answer **Yes** to loading **one plug-in at a time** and No to the rest until you determine which one causes the problem.
        * When you have determined which plug-in causes a problem, go back to **Tools - Options - Plug-ins** and **Check the Enabled box** for all of the plug-ins that don't cause a problem.

      * If **Rhino crashes in SafeMode** or you can't resolve the problem with these methods, contact us at http://www.rhino3d.com/support for help.
