John Marshall is undertaking research at The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen into the notion that digital tools such as Rhinoceros® enable new sets of creative, cultural and economic conditions for artists, architects, and designers.  Since 2002, Marshall has been working with sculptor Malcolm Cochran using Rhinoceros® as a design and visualisation tool for large scale public art projects.  This presentation will look at the contribution made by Rhinoceros® in the development of several works.


Marshall co-founded the company ‘rootoftwo’ in 1998 to research, develop, produce, and exhibit contemporary artworks, which incorporate emerging art forms and technology.  Previously, Marshall has worked as an Associate Lecturer in 3D Design at Leeds College of Art & Design and as a Designer/Model Maker for Evenflo Company, Inc.
