> October 2013 - Another periodic update... New tools, improvements, bugfixes...  Enjoy! :-)

====== MaqueTools toolbar ======

I have compiled a collection of scripts I have created over the last few years into a workspace - in the form of a master toolbar with flyouts.  I chose this form as it is easily portable and installable in any Rhino.

This version will only run in Rhino version 5 or later, there have been enough changes and additions to warrant abandoning backwards compatibility... More Python-based scripts have also been added, which will not run in V4 or earlier.

I use many of these tools every day, those have been more or less thoroughly tested, but there still may be bugs in some of them. [[rhinoceros@swissrhino.com|If you find a bug or failure, please report it to me]] (preferably with an example file) so I can fix it.  I try to make this stuff as reliable, user-friendly and bulletproof as possible, but there are no absolute guarantees - use at your own risk.

===== What's in the collection? =====

{{people:maquetools_explanations_v11.pdf|Here is a PDF file with a short description of the current toolset}} \\ 
- //over 100 tools currently (v1.1, 10.10.2013)//

{{people:maquetools.zip|Download the V5 toolbars set plus the PDF in a Zip file here}}
===== How do I install the tools?=====
The toolset is offered as a single V5 .rui file.  These may be imported into Rhino V5 in the usual fashion [[rhino:toolbarimports |(see here if you don't know how)]], otherwise, they may simply be opened as a separate workspace.  

Once open, you may copy the topmost button (MaqueTools) into your normal workspace.  You may then close the MaqueTools main toolbar (if you don't want it open all the time) and use the copied button to recall it when needed.  In V5, you can also dock the main toolbar as a tab if you are using the tabbed workspace.  

Alternatively, you may copy individual buttons or toolbars to your own workspace as desired, or even edit the buttons and pull out the scripts behind.  If you are copying scripts to modify/pass on, please credit the original author - me - there are no scripts from other people in this set...

Large thanks to Dale, Steve, Pascal, @ McNeel  as well as all the other scriptomaniacs that hang out on the Rhino scripting forum for all the help and support over the years!

===== Why aren't there image icons for all the buttons? =====
I don't have the time to design/implement button images for all, but if anyone is interested, I will be happy to accept contributions of images for the next version.  LOL
