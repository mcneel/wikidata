=====Question=====
We recently purchased a Rhino for Mac Education Lab License, and we are looking for strategies that will help us deploy it, configured to use a Zoo license server, on a number of computers are our university.

We use [[http://www.jamfsoftware.com/products/casper-suite/|Casper]] and other management systems to build packages and push applications out to client systems. This usually includes bundling the license configuration information in with the application for distribution.

=====Answer=====
Here is some information that will be helpful.

1.) When you run Rhino for Mac for the first time, it creates the following folders:

  /Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/License Manager
  /Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/License Manager/Licenses

Important: each of these folders is **chmod** with **+rwx** so any user can write information to it.

2.) The **Rhinoceros/License Manager/Licenses** folder contain's Rhino's license file, which for Rhino for Mac is named **781b000c-8d0b-4ed3-8ead-213bdb848f39.lic**. 

For standalone licenses, this file is encrypted, unreadable, and unique per system.

For network licenses, though, this file is clear text, readable, and can be moved between one system and another.

3.) For systems that have a network license, you will also find a **LicensesZooClient.settings** file that exists in the **Rhinoceros/License Manager** folder. This file is also clear text, readable, and can be moved between one system and another. It contains the name of the Zoo server as entered into Rhino.

If your deployment system can also performs steps 1, 2, and 3, in addition to pushing the Rhino application bundle into each system's Applications folder, then you should be able to deploy Rhino for Mac on all of your systems.
