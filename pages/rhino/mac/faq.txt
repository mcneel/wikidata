==== General ====

-->When will Rhino for Mac be released?#

Very soon.  Please see [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/t/rhino-for-mac-release-candidate-1/20047|this post]].

<--

-->When it is released, how much will it cost?#

We have not yet finalized our pricing, but less than Rhino for Windows.  There will be a pre-release promotional price for owners of Rhino 5 for Windows and limited-time post-release promotional price open to everyone.

<--

-->If I buy Rhino for Windows, will I get Rhino for Mac free?#

No, however, owners of Rhino 5 for Windows will be able to take advantage of a discounted pre-release promotion, where one Rhino 5 for Windows license can be used to get a special price on one copy of Rhino 5 for Mac.

<--

-->After Rhino for Mac releases, will there be Service Releases or Updates?#

Yes.  In fact, Rhino 5 for Mac updates will include both bug fixes as well as new features.  Features like Layouts and Worksessions, while not included in the initial release, are planned for subsequent updates.  Those who have purchased Rhino 5 for Mac will receive these updates at no additional cost.

<--

-->How is Rhino for Mac different from Rhino for Windows?#

  * Rhino for Mac's interface is significantly different from Rhino for Windows.
  * Rhino for Mac does not yet support Plugins (though support is planned soon).  [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/t/when-will-plugins-be-available-in-rhino-for-mac/20369|More info...]]
  * Rhino for Mac does not (yet) contain all the features of Rhino for Windows.  [[http://www.rhino3d.com/mac-feature-compare|More info...]]
  * Rhino for Mac does not contain all the command in Rhino for Windows.  [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/mac/rhino5wincommandsnotinrhino5mac|More info...]]

<--

-->Does the Rhino for Mac work in languages other than English?#

Yes. We currently support Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Japanese and Korean.  Rhino for Mac uses the default language selection built into OS X. 

To use a language that is different from the OS X default, in the application menu:
  - Navigate to **Rhinoceros** > **Preferences...** > **Language**.
  - In the **Language** panel, under **Rhino Language**, select your preferred language.

<-- 

-->What is a WIP?#

WIP stands for Work In Progress.  It is our form of "beta," and it's often is released in parallel with a stable commercial release but the WIP contains experimental or half-finished features.  WIPs are generally available to any user who owns the commercial (or Edu) version of the software.  The WIP is could be unstable, have bugs, and contain unfinished features.
<--

--> The WIP has a time limit. What happens when it expires?#

The expiration ensures that everyone is testing the latest version and not reporting problems that have already been fixed. 

Before each RhinoWIP version expires, a new WIP will be available for you to you [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5B/wip|download]]. RhinoWIP checks for updates each time it starts and will notify you if a new version is available. A notice will also be posted on the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/category/rhino-for-mac|Rhino for Mac section]] of the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/|Discourse Forum]] each time a new RhinoWIP version is available.

==== Compatibility ====

-->Are the 3DM files from Rhino for Mac compatible with Rhino for Windows?#

Yes, the Rhino 5 files are identical. You can also export Rhino 4 files for compatibility with Windows Rhino 4.

<-- 

-->What file formats does Rhino for Mac support?#

Quite a few.  Please see [[http://www.rhino3d.com/formats|this list of supported formats]].

<--

-->Can I use my two button / three button mouse?#

Yes, all Macs support mice with multiple buttons and scroll wheels. You can still use a single-button Mac mouse. To simulate clicking with the right-mouse button, hold the Control key while clicking the single button.

<-- 

-->Can I use a Spaceball/SpaceNavigator/SpaceExplorer?#

Only the SpaceNavigator is supported at this time.

<--

\\
==== Scripts and Plug-ins ====
-->Can I run a command script in Rhino for Mac?#

Yes. To load and run a command script, on the top menu, select **Tools > Commands > Read From File**.
 
<--

-->Can I run a RhinoScript program in Rhino for Mac?#

No. RhinoScript is based on VisualBasic and VisualBasic does not run on OS X. We are using Python for scripting on both the Mac and Windows version, and provides a way to write scripts for both versions of Rhino. See the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/category/scripting | Rhino scripting support forum]] for Python scripting support for both Windows and Mac.

<--


-->Will third-party plug-ins work on Rhino for Mac?#

Perhaps. However, Windows plug-ins will not work on the Mac. The decision to port a plug-in to Rhino for Mac will be up to each plug-in developer.
<--

-->Will Rhino for Mac support my .NET plug-in?#

Eventually. We are working on tools that will let Rhino plug-in developers write plug-ins that will run on both OS X and Windows.

<--

-->Will the Rhino for Mac version support my C/C++ plug-in?#

Eventually. However, we are not yet ready to provide user support for C plug-ins, but we plan to do so in the future. You will have to recompile your plug-in using the Xcode development system. Depending on the complexity of your plug-in, it may take only a small amount of work to create a plug-in that compiles and works both on Windows and the Mac.

==== Troubleshooting ====
-->How do I report a problem or bug?#

See [[reportingproblems|Reporting problems]].

<--

-->Rhino for Mac crashed! Now what do I do?#

See [[macrhinocrash|Rhino Crashed - Now What?]]

<--


-->Do I need to uninstall Rhino before installing a newer version?#
No. 
<-- 

-->OS X says "The following disk images couldn't be opened." What do I do now?#

You probably have a corrupted downloaded .dmg file.  Check that your downloaded .dmg file is valid. Files can sometimes become corrupted when downloaded.

  - Start the Disk Utility program **/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility**
  - From the menu, select **Images > Verify...** An Open File dialog box appears.
  - Select the .dmg file that you downloaded. It is usually in your Downloads folder and is named something like: Rhinoceros_5A123.dmg
  - If your downloaded file is not valid, go to [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5/evaluation|download]] and request another download link.
  - If this happens again, you have an unreliable internet connection and should try downloading the file using a different internet connection.  The download file is over 100 Mb.

<-- 

-->I installed the latest version of Rhino, and it still says that it is expired. Now what?#

You have more than one copy of Rhino installed, and it is still starting the expired version. You must remove **all** copies of Rhino. 

Double click any 3DM file. If the file opens in Rhino, then you still have a copy of Rhino installed somewhere. 
  - Right-click the Rhino icon in the Dock, select **Options > Show in Finder** from the menu to find out where it is.
  - Drag that copy to the Trash. 
  - When no more copies of Rhino exist, double-clicking a 3DM file will open it with TextEdit instead. When this happens, all copies of Rhinoceros have been removed.
  - Reinstall the version that you just downloaded.

<--


-->How do I uninstall Rhino for Mac?#

The following steps completely remove Rhino for Mac from your computer:

  - Remove the application in the Applications folder.
  - Remove the directory **/Library/Application Support/McNeel**. This directory contains the tutorial models and manuals if you downloaded them and may not exist on your computer.  This folder also contains your license file.
  - Remove the directory **~/Library/Application Support/McNeel** in your home directory. This directory is optionally used by Rhino and may not exist on your computer. It might contain materials you created, Python scripts, and other resources.
  - Remove the file **~/Library/Preferences/com.mcneel.rhinoceros.plist** in your home directory. This file contains all your Rhino preferences.

<--

\\
==== Other/Miscellaneous ====
 
-->The current version of Rhino for Mac has a problem. Can I download the previous version?#

No, previous versions of Rhino for Mac are not currently available.

<-- 


--> I want right click to repeat the last command!  Why can't I do this? #

You can, by disabling the Context menu, which allows the repeat behavior.

  - On the menu, click **Rhinoceros** and then click **Preferences**.
  - Select the **Mouse** panel.
  - In the **Right Mouse Button** section, clear the **Enable Context Menus** check box.

<--

--> Does Rhino for Mac support digitizers?#
