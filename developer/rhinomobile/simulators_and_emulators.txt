**About the Simulator**

**Rotation and Multi-touch**
  * To rotate the simulator, hold down //Command// and use the //Left/Right// arrow keys to rotate.
  * To simulate two touches, hold down the //alt/option// key while moving the cursor around the Simulator.
  * To simulate two touches while panning, how down the //alt/option// and //Shift// keys while moving the cursor around the Simulator.

**Accessing Files on the Simulator**

The best way to access the contents of the Simulator filesystem is to use a Terminal.  In OS X, open a terminal window and navigate to:

/Users/<you>/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/<ver>/Applications/<long app UDID number>/

(Remember you can use Tab to autocomplete paths as you change directories - useful for auto-completing the longer app UDIDs).

Alternatively, you can use Finder to navigate to the same folder, but you will have to change your Finder Preferences to show hidden files if you have not done so already.

For more information about where to store temporary or persistent resources, please check out the following Xamarin documentation [add link].

**Resetting the Simulator**

It is often necessary to clean out the entire contents of the simulator between builds, especially those builds in which you have modified or removed resources that may get cached on the simulator.  If you want a fresh start, open the iOS Simulator and select //iOS Simulator > Reset Content and Settings...// from the Application toolbar.  This will remove all user data, all apps and reset to the virtual "factory settings."  Note that this will also reset the app UDID numbers.
