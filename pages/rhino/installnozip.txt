=====Problem=====
The installer unzips but nothing happens after that.

=====Cause=====
This problem is caused by Microsoft PCA (Program compatibility assistant), perhaps because an earlier attempt to install Rhino was cancelled.

=====Answer=====
  - Restart Windows.
  - Open the file Explorer and browse to the downloaded executable file, and select it.
  - Press and hold **Shift**.
  - Right-click on the executable, then run it.
  - A small dialog asking for a language will come up.
  - Let up the Shift key.
  - Choose **English** and continue.

**//Note://** You may also get a message that you are trying install Rhino on an unsupported operating system. The fix for this problem is in the **[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/rhino5/win7_not_supported|Unsupported Windows]]**  article.
