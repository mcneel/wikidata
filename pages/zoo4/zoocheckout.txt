===== Question =====
I am trying to check out a license from my LAN Zoo floating license manager using Rhino's **CheckOutLicense** command. I keep getting the following error:

//License check out not enabled on this Zoo server. Please contact your system administrator for assistance.//

===== Answer =====
In order to check out a license from a Zoo server, the license checkout feature must be enabled. By default, it is disabled.

Note: 30-user Lab licenses are restricted to a 30 day check out maximum.
