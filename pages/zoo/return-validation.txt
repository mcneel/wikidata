======LAN Zoo License Validation: Return Validations======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //What to do when returning a license validation fails//

If you got to this page, you're likely trying to remove a license from LAN Zoo and got this error message:

> Your license cannot be deleted because the McNeel license server at https://api.mcneel.com could not be reached

This message is shown when LAN Zoo is able to access parts of the Internet, but cannot access McNeel's license servers at https://api.mcneel.com

**To Resolve The Error:**

  - Verify that a local or network firewall **is not blocking** port **443** access to the server **api.mcneel.com**
  - Try to remove the license again.

** If License Removal Still Fails:**

Please contact McNeel support at https://www.rhino3d.com/support
