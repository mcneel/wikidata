====== Problems saving AccuRender Plants ======



=====Problem:=====
When you try to save an AccuRender Plant you get an error message saying "can't save in read only library" or "cannot save the new item in a non-AccuRender folder".

=====Solution:=====

  * "can't save in read only library".
All the Plant Library folders except the User library are by design write protected. So try to save the Plant in the User Plant folder. If that folder also gives this error message please go to:  On XP C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\AccuRender\User Libraries and on Vista C: \User\ Public\Public Documents\AccuRender\ User Libraries on your computer. In this folder you should be able to find a file called user.plib Right click on the user.plib file and choose Properties. Please check that the Read only box isn't checked, if it is checked, uncheck it.

  * "cannot save the new item in a non-AccuRender folder".
This problem usually occurs on Vista. The problem is as the message is saying that you are trying to save the plant in a non-AccuRender folder. What you need to do is to make sure that when you get the Save As dialog box open you need to go in Save in: to My Computer > AccuRender Libraries > Plants > User. When you then press save, it should work.
