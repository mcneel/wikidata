Modeled in Rhino Rendered in Flamingo. This design is unique. I specially created sweeping curves blending the Bracelet to the Case creating a perfect harmony of Case and Bracelet. This design serves well to emphasise the free-form surface creation that Rhino provides. The bracelet segments have a perfect hinge system, more characteristic of the Goldsmithing Trade (much to the disgust of my Swiss Watchmaker friends!), I have started to encourage the young generation of Swiss Watch Designers to look beyond the limits of traditional watch design, to pioneer with me a fresh new generation of asthetically advanced shapes and forms, that are closer to scuplture than traditional Swiss-time-piece manufacture. The cost factor to produce such pieces commercially is rather prohibitive as each link has a unique shape, so don't expect to see such watches arrive on the market very soon, when they do, they will not be in the lower price bracket.

=====New technique of bronze coating.=====

Rinus Roelofs - I've added some pictures of my rapid prototyping models to my website. New is the technique of bronze coating. A thin layer of bronze is put on the nylon SLS-model. //[[http://www.rinusroelofs.nl/pr-rp-models/rp-models-00.html|See model 9 and 12...]]//
