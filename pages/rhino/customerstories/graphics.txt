ILLUSTRATION EXAMPLE WITH RHINO.

The tool of the pen I always felt it was tedious to use, the curves of Rhino can be manipulated with greater precision and a much more intuitive

and clear, then be able to use in other applications such as Adobe ® Illustrator ®, which can then implement color and edit each part to obtain

an more agile illustration, everything that relates to curves I prefer to work first with Rhino.
