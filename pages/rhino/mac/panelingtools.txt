PanelingTools is a specialized plugin developed by McNeel and made available for free to Rhino 5 for windows users. It will also be made available for the Rhino for Mac users once the plugin support is added to the Rhino for Mac. In the meanwhile, if you need to work with PanelingTools in the Mac, you can download the Rhino for Mac WIP. All PanelingTools commands are available through the "commandline" (type "pt" and the list of commands will Autocomplete).
