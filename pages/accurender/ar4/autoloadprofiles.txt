====== Autoload Question ======

> **Problem:** //How do I create different profiles to prevent ccMOTION & AccuRender loading each time I use AutoCAD?//

  * Solution:
    * This not stored in the Profile but in the Windows registry under the setting for the local machine. Therefore it is not a setting that the Profile can address.
    * coMotion is loaded by the Accurender.mnl file. By preventing the menu from loading, coMotion is also not loaded.
    * See [[accurender:ar4:autoload|Preventing AccuRender 4 from Autoloading]]
