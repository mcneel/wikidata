  * **Configuration:** Manipulate Windows-style initialization (INI) files, and access the Windows Registry.
  * **Processes:** Run operating system commands or other programs.
  * **Interface:** Get strings, integers, reals, and lists from the user. Display Windows message boxes, progress meters, and splash screens.
  * **Strings:** Tokenize strings, extract characters, find characters, insert, remove, and replace characters, and trim characters.
  * **Math:** Trigonometric calculations, vector manipulation, statistical analysis, and more.
  * **CAD:** Save all and close all open files. Preview drawings and list xrefs.
