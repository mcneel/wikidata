====== openNURBS 5.0 Migration Guide ======
> **Developer:** //[[developer:opennurbs:home|openNURBS]]//
> **Summary:** //Information to help you migrate your application to openNURBS 5.0.//

===== More information =====
More information and downloads for the toolkit and sample files are available from the [[http://www.opennurbs.org|openNURBS Initiative web site]].

===== Overview =====
The openNURBS 5.0 toolkit builds upon openNURBS 4.0 by adding the ability to read and write Rhino 5 3dm files.

For most developers, migrating to openNURBS 5.0 is as simple as recompiling their application against the new toolkit.

===== New Features =====

==== Lightweight Extrusions ====
Lightweight Extrusion objects creates simple extruded shapes using a much more lightweight representation than Brep (polysurface) objects. Lightweight Extrusions are represented by the **ON_Extrusion** class and have the object type of **ON::extrusion_object**.

In most cases, when you read 3dm files, you will want to convert the Lightweight Extrusion object to a Brep, and then just pass the Brep to the Brep handling code that you've already written.

<code c++>
ONX_model model = ...
...
for( int i = 0; i < model.m_object_table.Count(); i++ )
{
  const ONX_Model_Object& model_object = model.m_object_table[i];
  if( 0 == model_object.m_object )
    continue;

  if( ON::extrusion_object != model_object.m_object->ObjectType() )
    continue;

  const ON_Extrusion* extrusion = ON_Extrusion::Cast( model_object.m_object );
  if( 0 == extrusion )
    continue;

  ON_Brep* brep = ON_Brep::New();
  if( 0 == brep )
    continue;

  if( brep != extrusion->BrepForm(brep, true) )
  {
    delete brep; // don't leak...
    continue;
  }

  // TODO: do something with brep here...

  delete brep; // don't leak...
}

===== Changed Features =====

==== Text ====
  * Justification support for text added.
  * Text fields added:
    * Use TextValue() instead of UserText()
    * Use SetTextValue() instead of SetUserText()
  * TextFormula()
  * SetTextFormula()
  * Layout scaling added. Scale per detail/paperspace.
  * AnnotativeScaling()
  * SetAnnotativeScaling()
  * ON_Annotation2::m_annotative_scale
  * Text Mask support added for text and dimensions
    * DrawTextMask()
    * SetDrawTextMask()
    * MaskColorSource()
    * SetMaskColorSource()
    * MaskColor()
    * SetMaskColor()
    * MaskOffsetFactor()
    * SetMaskOffsetFactor()

==== Annotation Scaling ====
  * Per dimstyle for dimensions and global for text now
  * Document global settings for what scaling is done
  * New Rhino SDK class - CRhinoAnnotationSettingsEx:
    * Use CRhinoDocProperties::GetON_3dmAnnotationSettings() to access

==== Dimension Styles ====
  * Additions for worksessions and linked blocks.
  * Added the concept of child dimstyles so that fields can be overridden:
    * IsFieldOverride()
    * SetFieldOverride()
    * HasOverrides()
    * OverrideFields()
    * InheritFields()
    * IsChildDimstyle()
    * IsChildOf()
    * ParentId()
    * SetParentId()
  * New support for Tolerances, Text Masks, and Scaling per dimstyle
