=====Advice from a user:=====

Use an absolute tolerance of 0.0001.

Model only the organic parts of the model in Rhino, leaving features such as fillets, shelling, ribs, etc., for [[rhino:solidworks|SolidWorks]].

[[rhino:solidworks|SolidWorks]] usually does not consider Rhino tangencies to be tangent. Fortunately [[rhino:solidworks|SolidWorks]] provides some work-arounds with face fillets.

Another thing you can do is select the entire chain of "near tangent" edges in [[rhino:solidworks|SolidWorks]]. The filleter will then build a piece-wise fillet with "near tangent" segments, which is tangent within human perception. [[rhino:solidworks|SolidWorks]] helps with these problems with its right-click Select Tangent feature, which works on both edges and faces. This is an enormous help when filleting imported models.

Shelling, by nature, sometimes requires that some surfaces extend, but if your Rhino model has a singularity or other peculiarity where the extension should occur, then shelling is likely to fail.

Small wrinkles will stall the sheller if the curvature of the wrinkle is smaller than the requested wall thickness.

Try to model with smooth, over-sized slab surfaces whenever possible. Import a number of "mini models" as your Rhino model progresses to test feasibility. Use [[rhino:solidworks|SolidWorks]] "What's Wrong" feature to highlight problem areas, and investigate alternative approaches. Nothing replaces experience, and after you successfully work with a few imported models in [[rhino:solidworks|SolidWorks]] you will gain an intuitive feel for what works well.
