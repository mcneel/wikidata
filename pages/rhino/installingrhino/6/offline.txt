======Offline Installation of Rhino 6======

The Rhino installer is responsible for making sure your Windows installation has everything it needs to run Rhino. This includes the .NET framework and Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime redistributable packages. Because many computers already have these packages, they are not embedded in the installer. They are downloaded as needed during installation.

In order to install offline, however, you need to make sure these packages are available.

====Downloading Packages For Offline Installation ====
