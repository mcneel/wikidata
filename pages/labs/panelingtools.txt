=====Background=====
The PanelingTools (PT) plug-in helps generate 2D and 3D cellular patterns and populate them over rectangular grids.

The PT plug-in supports intuitive design of paneling concepts as well as rationalizes complex geometry into a format suitable for analysis and fabrication. The plug-in is closely integrated with Rhino 5 and is widely used for architectural and other building designers.
