====== Working with Plants ======

nXt includes a fun and powerful plant generator which efficiently generates complex entourage objects during rendering.  These plants have little impact on drawing size; only a place-holder is kept in AutoCAD.

Two broad categories of plants are included.  Tree-like plants (including shrubs and houseplants) are distinct objects which are inserted in specific locations.  In addition, an existing AutoCAD object can be tagged as groundcover to make it appear to sprout when rendered.


=== Obtaining nXt Plants  ===

nXt comes with a full-featured, easy to use, Plant Editor which enables you to create your own plants.  The Plant Editor is located in the Windows Start menu, under the folder nXt.

There are also several online sources for nXt plants, including the [[http://www.accurender.com/page/plant-libraries|Plant Library]] and [[http://www.accurender.com/page/mixed-content-libraries|Mixed-Content Library]] sections of the main AccuRender nXt website.  


**To Insert an nXt Plant:
**
  - Select Widgets->Plants->Add... from the nXt palette menu bar
  - Select the .ArPlant file you want to insert
  - Pick a Location for your plant in the drawing
  - Cancel or pick additional Locations for additional instances of the same plant
   
**To Tag an object as nXt Groundcover:
**
  - Select Widgets->Plants->Add Groundcover from the nXt palette menu bar
  - Select the .ArGroundcover file you want to insert
  - Select the object to tag

If you tag a 3D Solid object as groundcover, the groundcover will take on a "topiary-like" appearance.

**Additional notes on nXt Plants
**

  * Make sure the units are set correctly for your drawing.  The AutoCAD _UNITS command or _INSUNITS system variable controls this.
  * nXt Plants can be scaled, copied, and rotated.
  * Widgets->Plants->Randomize allows you to select a group of plants and randomize their scales and rotations
  * Widgets->Plants->Id tells you the name of a previously inserted plant
  * Widgets->Plants->Remove Groundcover allows you to "untag" an object previously tagged as groundcover.


=== Using Legacy Plants ===

Plants created in AccuRender 3 or 4 may be added to a drawing by using the //Add Legacy Plant...// option in the //Widgets->Plants// pulldown.  Once your legacy plant has been inserted, you can edit a few settings of the plant using the //Edit Legacy Plant// option.

**Additional notes on Legacy Plants
**

  * Legacy grouncover and vines are not available in nXt.
  * If you are using legacy plants and do not have AccuRender 3 or 4 installed, you will need to manually add all of the search paths necessary for your plants.  (Use the Options item on the menu bar to add search paths.)  The necessary paths include the path to the plant library, the path to the plant material library, and the paths to any textures or opacity maps required by the legacy plant.  Missing legacy plant materials during rendering is almost always due to missing search path information.  This issue is particularly relevant for 64 bit systems, since these will not have had previous installations of AccuRender.
  * Legacy drawings with plants already inserted should work subject to the restrictions above.
  * Legacy plants are very different than the new nXt plants.  Currently you cannot convert legacy plants to nXt plants.
