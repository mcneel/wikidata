======Display Troubleshooting: Virtualization Systems ======

Some people say Rhino 5 works great on VMware, Parallels, and other virtualization systems. Others have no end of problems with it. McNeel doesn't officially support these platforms. If they work for you, great. If not, we can't help. Try posting a question on the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/category/rhino-for-windows|McNeel Discourse Forum]].
