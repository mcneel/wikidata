===== How did my file size get so huge? =====


> Periodically there is a post on the Rhino forum by a user that has seen their relatively simple file grow to a huge size and they don't understand why or how to reduce the size back to "normal".  This article will attempt to explain what has happened and why; as well as offer some possible fixes.

===What causes "file bloat"?===

Many things can dramatically add to file size:

  * **Display meshes** - Rhino uses special meshes to display surface objects on the screen. Very fine display mesh settings can cause large file sizes without you realizing it. You see the display as normal, but you are not necessarily aware of how many polygons the display mesh has.

  * **Textures** - High resolution bitmap textures (usually used as render materials) that are stored in the file can dramatically increase file size.

  * **Plug-ins** can also create their own data and store it in the file; this data can be quite massive as well.

  * **Big data** - finally, Rhino files can simply contain **massive amounts of geometry** in the form of curves, surfaces or meshes.  Large file sizes in this case are to be expected...

===How can I see where the problem is?===

Well, having read the above, you might already have some "usual suspects" in mind.  If so, you may be able to skip this section and go to the "possible remedy" section below.

However, if you are stumped, or just want to see all of what your file contains in extreme geeky detail, you can use the **Audit3dmFile** command inside of Rhino.  You can run this on the Rhino file you currently have open or even some other 3dm file on your computer.  A text window will open with a lot of info.  At the top will be info about your Rhino and what plug-ins are loaded.  Below that comes the interesting part, the various tables where information is stored.  

  * First is the **"Bitmap Table"**.  It will tell you how many bitmaps are in the file, and most importantly the total size.  If you see some very large numbers in there (they are in bytes, so be careful) that might explain part of your file size.

  * Next is the **"Material Table"**, which you should also check for size.  

  * Further down is the **"Object Table"**, which will give you a summary of how much storage space your actual geometry is taking up.

  * Lastly, at the bottom is the **"Model User Data Table"**, whicj enumerates all the plug-ins that are storing data.  If any of those are very large, that is another suspect to consider.
