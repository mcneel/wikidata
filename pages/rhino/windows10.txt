=====Specific Technical Issues with Windows 10=====
  * Generally Rhino runs very well on Windows 10. We recommend Windows 10 as a substantial upgrade from Windows 8.
  * On initial install, Windows 10 does not update video drivers. We recommend updating the video drivers on the computer.  Go to the [[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:failure|Video Troubleshooter for instructions]].
  * Some customers have reported the error below.  A simple restart of the computer will fix this.
