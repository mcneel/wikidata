=====Background=====
The PanelingTools (PT) plug-in helps generate 2D and 3D cellular patterns and populate them over rectangular grids.

The PT plug-in supports intuitive design of paneling concepts as well as rationalizes complex geometry into a format suitable for analysis and fabrication. The plug-in is closely integrated with Rhino 5 and is widely used for architectural and other building designers.

=====Download=====

===For Rhino 5 SR9 for Windows 32- and 64-bit (December 2014)===
  * Download and double-click **[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/PanelingTools/1.0/wip| PanelingTools installer]] **to install. When opening a new session of Rhino, the installed version will be loaded (no need to drag&drop or use PluginManager to load). Toolbars are also installed, but for the first use you need to load using Tools/Toolbar Layout...
  * PanelingTools plug-in also extends Grasshopper.  **[[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/panelingtools|Click for details...]]** 
  * {{:labs:singlestrokefont.zip|Single stroke font}} (optional). Add this font to your Windows font directory. For example, in Windows 7, drag the RhSS.ttf file into //Control Panel>Appearance and Personalization>Fonts//. The font will then be accessible from Rhino. This type of font is used mainly to tag parts for laser cutting.

If you own a Rhino for Mac license and want to access PanelingTools, download and install the Rhino for Mac WIP.  Please note that the Rhino for Mac WIP is a Work-In-Progress. This means it includes the latest features and development, but it also means that there may be instability and bugs.  New WIPs are released frequently as we add features and fix bugs.  In the WIP, there is no PanelingTools menu and all the commands are available through the command line only.  Type **pt** to see all the PanelingTools commands in the AutoComplete list.
