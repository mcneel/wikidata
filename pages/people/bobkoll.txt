======Lab Tips, Tricks, Projects======

**[[http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/Lamp_bk.zip|Table Lamp Project for Laser Engraver]]**
This tutorial will work as a scroll-saw or cnc milling project also. Instructions are in 'Notes'.

**[[http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/BKwheel_tutorial.zip|Wheel model from jpgs]]**
The two jpg files are included as well as instructions in 'Notes'.  Use PictureFrame command rather than Background Bitmap command.

**[[http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/11x8_Templates.zip|Two Rhino Templates for High School design/drafting classes v4]]**
A one page Word document about making Page Layouts for a high school archihtecture class.

A template for an architectural model including a 11 x 8.5 page layout.

A template for a mechanical part including a 11 x 8.5 page layout. (File, notes contains some instructions for using this template.)

Open the models and 'Save As Template'.  Name them as you wish.  When you change the template remember to 'Save As Template' so your changes become part of the template.


**[[http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/PageLayouts_bk.zip|PageLayout tutorial v4]]**
This tutorial contains a word document and a Rhino model; a work in progress.  Edit as needed to meet your needs.

<color red>**Large Projects with Repeated Parts**</color> Create blocks of the parts.  Insert them when needed.  And, as a rule, Save Small.  Ferndale HS student created a 309meg model. After Save Small it was 201megs.  After creating 'blocks' of the repeated parts, the file size went to 45megs.  As a rule, encourage your students to <color red> 'Save Small'</color> to reduce file sizes on your server.
