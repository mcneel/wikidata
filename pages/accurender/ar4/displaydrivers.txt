=====AccuRender 4 and NVIDIA drivers=====
4/26/06 - I just got off the phone with an AccuRender user in Georgia.  He says that AccuRender 4 is very unstable under NVIDIA's current released drivers.  He said that at www.autodesk.com, he found a list of "approved cards" for [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2007, that had specific details on versions that worked and versions that didn't. He said that the NVIDIA driver he downloaded from the Autodesk site fixed his AccuRender 4 crashing problems.  Here's the URL:
