=====Question=====
I have drawn an ellipse in Rhino, using the Ellipse command. While reading the .3dm file, using openNURBS, the ellipse is classified as as ON::curve_object. But I am unsure how to get the ellipse's construction data, such as center point, major and minor axes, etc.

=====Answer=====
Unlike some curve types (e.g. Lines, Arcs, Polylines, etc.) which have their own **ON_Curve**-derived classes, there is no special class that is used to represent elliptical curves. Ellipses and elliptical arcs are simply NURBS, or **ON_NurbsCurve**, curves.

To test to see if a curve is an ellipse or an elliptical arc, first try to cast the **ON_Curve** object as an **ON_NurbsCurve** object. If successful, then use **ON_NurbsCurve::IsEllipse()** to verify the NURBS curve is an ellipse and to obtain its construction data.

=====Example=====

<code c++>
ONX_Model model;

...

const ON_Curve* curve = ...;

...

const ON_NurbsCurve* nurb = ON_NurbsCurve::Cast( curve );
if( nurb )
{
  ON_Ellipse ellipse;
  double tolerance = model.m_settings.m_ModelUnitsAndTolerances.m_absolute_tolerance;
  bool rc = nurb->IsEllipse( 0, &ellipse, tolerance );
  if( rc )
  {
    // Center
    ON_3dPoint origin = ellipse.plane.origin;

    // Major and minor axes
    ON_3dVector xaxis = ellipse.radius[0] * ellipse.plane.xaxis;
    ON_3dVector yaxis = ellipse.radius[1] * ellipse.plane.yaxis;

    // Quad points
    ON_3dPoint p0( origin - xaxis );
    ON_3dPoint p1( origin + xaxis );
    ON_3dPoint p2( origin - yaxis );
    ON_3dPoint p3( origin + yaxis );

    // Foci
    ON_3dPoint f1, f2;
    ellipse.GetFoci( f1, f2 );
  }
}
