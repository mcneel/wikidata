======Reading Render Meshes with OpenNURBS======

> **Summary:** //Discusses how to read render meshes using the openNURBS toolkit//

=====Question=====
We’ve developed software to read 3DM files, but we found the software can only read [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] data. Render meshes are ignored. Our software takes a long time to generate these meshes. Do we provide methods that allow third-party developers to read render mesh from 3DM  files?

=====Answer=====
An object's render meshes are stored on that object. For example, the render meshes for an ON_Brep object are stored on that brep. The developer can obtain an object's render meshes from a brep by calling **ON_Brep:GetMesh**.

Note: If the call to **ON_Brep:GetMesh** does not return any meshes, then the object did not have any render meshes.

If you are referencing the **Example_read** sample included with the openNURBS toolkit, then after the 3DM file has been read, you can obtain the render meshes from the **ONX_Model** object as follows:

<code c++>
ONX_Model model = .....

int i;
for( i = 0; i < m_object_table.Count(); i++ )
{
 ONX_Model_Object model_object = m_object_table[i];
 ON_Brep* brep = ON_Brep::Cast( model_object->m_object );
 if( brep )
 {
   ON_SimpleArray<const ON_Mesh*> meshes;
   int mesh_count = brep->GetMesh( ON::render_mesh, meshes );
   if( mesh_count )
   {
      // TODO: do something with the array of meshes..
   }
 }
}
