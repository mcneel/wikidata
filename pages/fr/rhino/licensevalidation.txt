====== Validation de licence ======

======Pourquoi valider sa licence ?======
La validation de licence remplace la protection matérielle. Certaines licences de Rhino 3.0 devaient être accompagnées d'une clé de protection matérielle pour fonctionner. Ces clés étaient chères pour le client, parfois difficiles à installer et ralentissaient Rhino.

All customers that would have required to have a hardware lock (primarily customers in Asia) will now be asked to validate their Rhino license. In general, this should be much less painful than getting hardware locks to work.

The only piece of information used during license verification is your CD-Key, which is included when you buy Rhino. Registration is not required, nor is any personal information. No computer-specific information, or information derived from your computer is sent to Robert McNeel & Associates.
