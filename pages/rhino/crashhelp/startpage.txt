===== Crash when double-clicking a Rhino .3dm file =====


**Try:**\\
Start Rhino from a desktop **shortcut**, or the **Start** menu.

**If Rhino starts:**\\
  * Open a file from the **File** menu > **Open** or the **Open** toolbar button.\\ 
  * If the file won't open, the problem is probably with the file. Try the **Audit3dmFile** command on the file.

**Is the problem solved?**
  * **Yes**. YAY!\\
  * **No**. Go to: //[[rhino:crashhelp:fail_shortcut|Rhino won't start from shortcut]]//.
