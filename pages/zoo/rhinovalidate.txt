======Adding Rhino Licenses to LAN Zoo======

> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses adding and validating Rhino licenses with the LAN Zoo//

>When you add a Rhino license to the Zoo, you are asked to validate the license online. Rhino licenses must be validated before they can be used. 
>
>**Admins:** If you are behind a Firewall, open https access (TCP port 443) to api.mcneel.com

<color red>**Critical: If you are upgrading to Rhino, keep track of which previous version license key you used to upgrade. You can only use each previous version license key once.**</color>

The only piece of information used during license verification is your license key, which is included when you buy Rhino. 

Registration is not required, nor is any personal information. No computer-specific information, or information derived from your computer is sent to Robert McNeel & Associates.
