====== Rhino V5 reports "Bad image" and won't start ======
Created September 2017 - JB
\\
====Problem====
Attempting to start Rhino V5 reports "Rhino.exe - Bad image" (64-bit) or |Rhino4.exe - Bad image" (32-bit), with an Error status 0xc0000020.
The current version of **McAfee** antivirus is deleting the contents of Rhino system file leaving them empty.

====Symptoms====

Some users are reporting that after a recent update, Rhino V5 64-bit will not start. Our original guess was this was caused by an unknown Windows update. Now there are clear indications this is caused by the current version of **McAfee** anti-virus.\\

Windows pops up a message like this about a damaged file:
{{ :rhino:5:v5_bad_image.png |Rhino.exe - Bad Image}}

====The Fix====
===1 - Rhino  needs to be repaired===
In Windows Control Panel:
  - Run the Programs and Features tool
  - Find **Rhinoceros V5 (64-bit)** on the list
  - Select it and choose the **Repair** option
  - Find **Rhinoceros V5** on the list
  - Select it and choose the **Repair** option

  * If Windows reports it can not find the MSI file to repair Rhino, [[rhino:5:http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5/latest|download the installer]], and run it. If it asks, choose the **Repair** option.

===2 - Block McAfee===
The problem will likely come back if you do not block McAfee from the Rhino system files.
You can configure McAfee to exclude the **C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System** folder where these files are stored.\\

Hopefully McAfee will figure this out. So far, we have been unable to contact them with these details.
