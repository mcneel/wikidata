====== Wacom tablet info and issues ======

**Why does my Wacom tablet not work correctly?**
Users of Rhino 4/5 who have Wacom tablets often have the following observations:

  - Viewport panning/zooming/rotating stops working at the border of a view, unlike with the mouse.
  - Viewport panning/zooming/rotating across the border of a view sends the view off to infinity.

The Wacom tablet **must be set to mouse mode**, not pen mode. Note, this was also required with earlier versions of Rhino. But, the difference between V4/V5 and earlier versions is that it wraps the cursor around the active viewport(earlier versions wrapped the cursor around the entire monitor). Thus you notice the effects describe above quicker.

**Note:** Rhino 5 has a new option (Tools > Options > View> Viewport properties: **Wrap cursor at viewport borders**) that allows you to enable/disable wrapping cursor around the active viewport.
