====== Tips and advice for using Rhino together with Delcam '''PowerMILL''' ======

======Rhino and Delcam PowerMILL======

Rhino and **PowerMILL** work really well together. **PowerMILL** has direct reading of Rhino 3DM files and so you don't need to go through IGES or some other neutral format. **PowerMILL** is [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] based, so works smoothly with Rhino data.

You may also find Delcam's free modeller **PowerSHAPE-e** a useful addition to your Rhino toolkit. It also reads Rhino files directly.
