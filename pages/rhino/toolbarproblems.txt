====== Rhino 5: Toolbar Edits Not Saving ======
If Rhino is unable to save any edits to your toolbar layout (the original default keeps coming back after you close and reopen Rhino) you may have a problem with Windows' file-writing permissions.  [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/toolbarproblemsv5|See this page for some suggestions on how to test/fix this.]]  

//**Note:** Always edit your toolbar layout with only one instance of Rhino open. Otherwise your edits may be wiped out (overwritten) by another unmodified instance of Rhino closing.//
=====Toolbar disappearing problems in Rhino V4 and V5=====

If one day you open Rhino and all your toolbars are gone, don't panic!  There is usually a simple solution to get them back.

If your toolbars are doing a constant disappearing act, though, there is something else wrong, contact McNeel support with your problem.

=====Toolbar docking problems in Rhino V3=====

If you have a problem with toolbar layouts not sticking and docking correctly in Rhino V3, try:
  * Close Rhino 3.0
  * While Rhino is closed, run the following utility: http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/Rhino3_Registry_Repair.zip
  * Restart Rhino 3.0

The utility deletes the following key in the registry to make Rhino forget the settings that make the toolbars not dock correctly:
//HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\3.0\Scheme: Default\Control bar manager//
