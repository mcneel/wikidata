====== McNeel Training Overview ======

McNeel offers a variety of training options that included on-site, online and custom.
With the exception of custom, McNeel training is based on our training guides. The training guides are not tutorials but class notes to accompany the instructor-led training. 
You can prepare for the class by downloading the eval software (if you do not already have it), reviewing the outline and manual for your class. By doing this, you will be well on your way to learning Rhino before taking training.

Q: //Having some idea on how it works but not having used, would Level 2 be appropriate? I´d like to reach a good level to manage the tool properly or at least knowing that I can use it well enough. // 
A: Level 2 assumes Level 1 proficiency. So download and review the Level 1 and Level 2 materials above, and see which one best fits your current skill level.

Q: I´m looking for an online course in the next few months.  Is there a possibility to start the course a little bit sooner? 
A: If you register for the Level 1 and/or Level 2 class, and waive the option to drop, we can release the videos from the previous class for your study and preparation. You will get the videos from the previous class, the live class and the videos from the live class. The videos are posted to a private video album for you to steam or download to your computer.

A: Yes, all sessions are recorded and posted for streaming or download from a private vimeo album.

Q: Would you provide the link to download the version that is going to be used in the Rhino class?
