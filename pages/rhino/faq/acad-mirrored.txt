====== My Rhino Text is Mirrored in AutoCAD. Why? ======

===== Background =====
When a Rhino file is exported to DWG/DXF and opened in AutoCAD, the text may appear incorrectly mirrored. 
Let's look at the most common reason why this happens.

===== Rhino "Text reads forward" Setting=====
In the Rhino's **Annotation Style**, there is a setting under the **Font** page called [[https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/7/help/en-us/index.htm#documentproperties/annotation.htm#(null)|Text reads forward when viewed from behind]].

This allows the text to stay //always readable// or forward even when it is viewed from behind or from the bottom.

This setting works great if you stay in Rhino. 
However if you plan to export to //AutoCAD DWG/DXF// and open in AutoCAD, you will have problems. 

The reason is that **AutoCAD does not have a corresponding setting in its //Text// or //Dimension style//**.
So you must avoid this setting in Rhino, to guarantee visual parity between what you see in Rhino and what you will see down stream in AutoCAD.
===== The Solution =====
If you plan to export to AutoCAD, you will need to turn off this setting [[https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/7/help/en-us/index.htm#documentproperties/annotation.htm#(null)|"Text reads forward when viewed from behind"]] in your Annotation style.

  -  In Rhino, go to **Options** command and navigate to Annotation style(s).
  -  Under **Font**, turn OFF or uncheck the setting:  //"Text reads forward when viewed from behind"//.
  -  Inspect your model and look for text this is no longer readable.
  -  Use the Rotate command to rotate each piece of text with the Gumball 180 degrees in the Right viewport.
