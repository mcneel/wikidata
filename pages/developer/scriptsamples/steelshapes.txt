=====Question=====
Do you know of any script routines to draw standard steel shapes, such as channels, flanges and angles?

=====Answer=====
The following sample script demonstrates how to draw four different steel shapes:

  - Angles
  - Channels
  - T-Sections
  - Wide Flanges

The script subroutines look up shape parameters in a configuration, or INI file. Thus, the script can be easily extended to draw additional sizes by simply modifying the configuration file.

For installation, see the "Readme.txt" file found in the downloadable zip file.
