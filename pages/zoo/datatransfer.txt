====== Data Transmitted Between Client and LAN Zoo Server ======

> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses what type of data is being transmitted between the client and Lan Zoo Server on port 80.//

When a Zoo client requests a network license, these details will pass through Port 80 in the Client and on the Lan Zoo Server:

  * Computer name
  * User name
  * ID of the product license they are requesting 

The Lan Zoo that has a license available, replies with the license that is being loaned to that client.

The Zoo needs the computer name and user name to know that if a second instance of Rhino is being opened on computer that already has a license of Rhino from the Lan Zoo, do not check out an additional license. 

The Zoo client communicates both it's computer name and user name to the Lan Zoo, for both Mac and Windows OS.
This is required to check out a license properly at the server and prevent a second instance from triggering the use of a second key.

When the server sees the same computer name and user name, it allows it to use the key that is already in use again.


//Note:// Rhino does not send any hardware information such as IP, Mac address, Windows serial number about the client.
