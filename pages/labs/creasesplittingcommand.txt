====== Crease Splitting Command ======
> **Summary:** //The **CreaseSplitting** command lets you control when Rhino surface creation commands automatically divide creased surfaces into polysurfaces with edges at the creases.//

===== Notes =====
This plug-in is included in the [[http://download.rhino3d.com/rhino/5.0/wip/|Rhino 5.0 WIP]]. Command name is **CreaseSplitting** in V5.

=====Background=====

The "CreaseSplitting" command is in a V4 Labs plug-in called **SurfaceCreases.rhp**.  This is an update to the Rhino V3 plug-in and command.  This command will be built into Rhino V5.  V3 users requested that we provide a V4 version of this plug-in and command.

=====Crease Splitting Overview=====

The **CreaseSplitting** command line looks like

   Split creased surfaces into smooth polysurfaces ( SplitAlongCreases=Yes/No )

If SplitAlongCreases=Yes, then when Rhino surface creation commands like ExtrudeCrv create a surface with a crease, the result will be a polysurface that has edges at creases.

If SplitAlongCreases=No, then when Rhino surface creation commands like ExtrudeCrv create a surface with a crease, the result will be a single surface with creases.


=====Installation=====

1. If you have not installed the latest Microsoft runtime libraries, then download and install them by clicking on the the link http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/vcredist_x86.exe

2. Download the plug-in file **[[http://download.mcneel.com/download.asp?id=SplitCreases&language=|SurfaceCreases.rhp]]** to a folder on your computer.

3. From Windows Explorer, double-click on the SurfaceCreases.rhp file to install it as a Rhino 4.0 plug-in.



> **WARNING:** //Installing this plug-in and activating SplitAlongCreases=No will cause Rhino to create kinked surfaces from several commands, including Loft and Extrude.  These surfaces can be potentially bad objects for downstream processing (some other programs don't like them), and may also cause problems with the Rhino mesher (objects may display strangely, and exporting in mesh formats may become problematic).  <color red>**//USE AT YOUR OWN RISK...//**</color>  To turn off the behavior, run the command and and set SplitAlongCreases to Yes.//

=====Fixing crease splitting problems=====


For unknown reasons, some Rhino installations may exhibit the same behavior as activating SplitAlongCreases=No, even when the plug-in is not installed.  To fix the problem, the easiest way is to install the plug-in anyway, and then run the command, and set SplitAlongCreases to Yes.  This should fix it.  If not, please report this to the Rhino newsgroup or <suppport@mcneel.com>.
