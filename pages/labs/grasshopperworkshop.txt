The core of Grasshopper is the component. [[http://grasshopper.rhino3d.com/2008/06/objects-explained_05.html|Detailed explanation of components]].

> **Document:** //Objects Explained.pdf//
> **Definition:** //Need to build up a definition that can be used to create these objects.  Perhaps a circle based definition.//

====Parameter component type====
Parameters are a special type of component.  Many times you might start with a definition. Parameters are singular entities that reference or contain data. In traditional programing they are most similar to declared variables. Typically parameters are your starting and controlling values in the definition. There are three types of parameters: Primitive, U\I, and Geometry.

\\
  * **Primitive component**
    * Holding a value
    * As a translator
{{:legacy:en:simple_Param.jpg}}

> **Definition:** //Simple parameters - Build a definition with floats and integers. See the results. Start with the multi component.  Set a float to each input. See the result. Change one of the inputs. See results.  Then run one of the floats through a int param to round it off.//
\\
  * **U\I components**
    * The slider
{{:legacy:en:geometric_param.jpg}}

> **Definition:** //Simple parameters - Build a definition with points and circles see the results.//
\\
  * **Geometry parameter components**
    * Picking from a Rhino object
    * Implicit components
{{:legacy:en:geometric_param.jpg}}

> **Definition:** //Simple parameters - Build a definition with points and circles. See the results. Start with the C,N,R circle component.  Add a point param. set to C.  Then set a Float param to R.  See the result.  Introduce that a param can handle multiple objects.  Right-click on point.  Then select multiple select.  Pick multiple points. You should see many circles.  If you want them to draw multiple Rhino points, then select them all with the Point param.  You can now move the points around.//
\\
  * **Parameter component colors**
    * Orange - empty
    * Grey - with data
    * Hatched - not previewing

> **Definition:** //Simple parameters//
\\

====Component====
  * Compared to a primitive, component is more involved since it contains input and output parameters, expressions, data matching behavior.
  * A standard component takes information from its left and processes the data out to the right.
  * Component color\status.
    * Orange - not enough inputs.
    * Grey - functioning fine with data
    * Red - a component which contains at least one error. The error can come either from the component itself or from one of its input/output parameters. 
    * Hatched - not previewing

  * Volatile vs Persistant Data Management in components

====Sorting====
  * Sorting on list with another
  * Numbering the order with 3D text

> **Definition:** //Continuing with the Booleans definition above, sort the points based on their distance from an atractor point on the curve.  You can use the Tag object to number the points to show their sort order.  As an extension, you can draw a circle from the atractor point to the 6th sorted point.//

  * Using Clusters
  * Cluster tips and tricks

====Script component====
Inside a Grasshopper workshop only the most basic of scripting concepts can be presented. A script component can be used to manupulate data in a way that existing components cannot. You can also create geometry with script components.  Grasshopper can handle both C# and VB.NET coded components.  It is important to note here that Grasshopper does not support [[developer:rhinoscripting|RhinoScript]] directly. The VB.NET component is the best to use if you are coming from the RhinoScript language. There are quite a few differences between RhinoScript and VB.NET, so it will take time to make the transition.  This course covers only VB.NET.

  Definition: http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/points_examples.zip
===General setup===
When you drag and drop a VB.NET component you get a base VB.NET code component.  By default it has two inputs (x & y) and one output (A).  It also has a message output (out) to see error messages.

To edit the component, just double-click on the component. You will get a basic code editor.

{{:legacy:en:basescripting.jpg}}
You cannot edit the gray areas.  The white background area is where you add your own code.

===Simple scripting flow: Seeing a script as a loop===
Each time a piece of data flows into an input, the script you type runs.  In the most simple case a script can be used as a math function. This could also be done with a math function component, but it is used here as a simple example of scripting.

{{:legacy:en:simple_script.jpg}}
  Sub RhinoScript(ByVal angle As Object)

   ' Set return value to the cosine of the input angle
   A = Cos(angle)

  End Sub
Here you can see that every time the slider is changed, the code runs in the VB.NET component.  The last line of the code states **A =**.  This is the place that the output value is assigned the A output on the component.

Also, there is a line the starts with a **'**.  This make the line a comment.  It is ignored by the code when it runs, but is used to comment the code to help us understand what is going on.

===Variables===
Perhaps the most important part of VB.NET programming is understanding variables and datatypes.  Variables are containers of the information. The value of data in a variable can change within your code. It is through variables that you store, edit, and retrieve information. There are a few basics to understand about variables.

Variables are containers of information. And, like any real container, depending on what you intend to store in the container you may select from different containers sizes and styles. It is important to know the type of data you intend to contain in the variable.  Each piece of data you intend to work with has a different size and therefore requires a different size container.

When you create a new Variable in VB.NET you must declare what type (size) the container needs to be in order to hold the information you have.

  * Input Data
    * Basic Input
      * Location of input variables - At the top of the code
      * Type - Object unless using the Type Hint on the input itself
      * Adding - Adding more inputs
      * Subtracting - Subtracting inputs
      * Renaming - Right-click to rename input names
    * Declaring variables
      * Basic variable types - Value types: Boolean, Char, Integer, Long, ULong, Double, etc.
     This line declares a simple Integer container with the name is i.
     Dim i As Int32
      * Reference Variable types String, Object.
     Dim name As String = "Arthur"
\\
     Dim name As Object = "Arthur"

      * Object Variable Types - [[developer:opennurbs|opennurbs]] objects (ON3dPoint, ONCircle etc) or any object of a user defined class. These containers require a //new// statement when they are being created to invoke the constructor of the object and initialize object member variables.  Otherwise it is initialized to null:
     Dim pt As New On3dPoint 'Initialized to (0,0,0) by the default constructor
     Dim pt As New On3dPoint(1.0, 2.0, 3.0) 'User initialize point
     pt.x = 10 'Changing value of a member variable

  * Outputting data
    * Method - Use "A ="

  Sub RhinoScript(ByVal point As ON3dPoint, ByVal dis As Object)

   point.x = point.x + (2 * dis)
   point.y = point.y + (dis * cos(dis))
   point.z = point.z

   A = point

  End Sub
    * Types
    * Multiple Outputs - Sometimes you want to output more than one variable each time the loop goes through.  For instance if you have two input lists you would like to combine.  In this example you have two lists of 5 items each. So you are going to go through your code 5 times.  The problem is that you want to output one list with 10 items.  So each time through the code, you will want to output two items.  To do this you need to use a List object.
  Dim points As New List(Of On3dPoint)

To add a new member of a list use the .add method

  points.Add(new_pt)

Here is a full sample:

   Sub RunScript(ByVal x As Object, ByVal y As Object)
     Dim Sorted As New List(Of Object)
     Sorted.Add(x)
     Sorted.Add(y)
     A = Sorted
   End Sub

  * Looping - Stadard VB.NET looping and flow control can be used.
    * If..Then
    * For...Next

**Definition**
 
  * [[developer:opennurbs|opennurbs]] sample - [[developer:opennurbs|opennurbs]] is the way we create and access geometry items in Rhino.NET.  You can create points, lines, and many other geometry types.
  * Using [[developer:opennurbs|opennurbs]] objects.
  * If you find that you have students that are familiar with RhinoScript, you may want to present some of the differences between [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] and Grasshopper's VB.NET code. [[developer:rhinoscriptingvsdotnet|Some differences between RhinoScript and .NET]]
