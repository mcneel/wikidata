======How Does Rhino for Mac Find a LAN Zoo Server?======

> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|LAN Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //An overview of how Rhino for Mac finds a Zoo license manager server//

When Rhino needs a license from a LAN Zoo server, it determines the name of the LAN Zoo server by looking in the following locations in this order:
  - The Settings file in the Application Support folder. Looks for the host name or IP address of your LAN Zoo server.
  - Queries your Domain Name System (DNS) server for the default LAN Zoo server name.
  - Looks for the LIC file. See [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/rhinomacdeployment|Rhino for Mac Managed Distribution]].

=====More information=====

====Settings file====

When running as a network node, Rhino determines the name of the LAN Zoo server by first looking in the **LicensesZooClient.Settings** file in this folder:


===Rhino 8===

  /Users/Shared/McNeel//Rhinoceros/8.0/License Manager

===Rhino 7===

  /Users/Shared/McNeel//Rhinoceros/7.0/License Manager

===Rhino 6===

  /Users/Shared/McNeel//Rhinoceros/6.0/License Manager
  

The contents of this file looks similar to:

<code>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!--Zoo client settings file written by Rhino-->
<ZooClient>
Â  <Software_McNeel_Rhinoceros_6.0_License_Manager Server="host name or IP address" />
</ZooClient>
</code>
Note: //Software_McNeel_Rhinoceros_6.0_License_Manager// above is correct. 

====Using DNS===
If Rhino cannot determine the name of the Zoo server by searching in the Settings file, it then queries your DNS server for the default Zoo server, which is the following host name:

<code>
__mcneel.__zoo5
</code>

For example, if your company's domain is //mcneel.com//, then you can add a DNS alias of //<nowiki>__mcneel.__zoo5.mcneel.com</nowiki>// which points to your Zoo server.
