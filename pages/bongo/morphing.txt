======Bongo 2.0 - How to use the new Morphing feature ======
=====What is Morphing?=====

Morphing is a special effect in motion pictures and animations that changes (or morphs) one image/objects into another through a seamless transition.

With the help of Bongo 2.0 you can animate simple changes to objects in Rhino by moving the objects control points.
