====== Debugging with Rhino4_d.exe ======

===== Question =====
I am in the process of building my first plug-in with the Rhino C++ SDK. When I press **F5** to start debugging, I receive the following error:

**Unable to start program 'C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 4.0\System\Rhino4_d.exe**

Here is the rest of the error:

//"This application has failed to start because the application configuration
is incorrect.  Review the manifest file for possible errors.  Reinstalling
the application may fix the problem.  For more details, please see the
application event log."//

What can I do to resolve this so I can debug my plug-in?

===== Answer =====

In order to run the debug version of Rhino, or **Rhino4_d.exe**, the following requirements must be met:

  - You must have a **non-evaluation** version of Rhino installed on your system. That is, you need either a **Commercial**, **Educational**, or **Not-For-Resale** version of Rhino installed on your system.
  - The **version and service release** number of Rhino that you are using **must match** the version and service release number Rhino SDK that you are building with. For example, if you are using a Commercial version of Rhino 4.0 SR7, you must also have the Rhino 4.0 SR7 C++ SDK in order to run debug Rhino.
  - Your system must have the **same debug libraries** on your system that we use to build Rhino. To ensure this, make sure your system is “up-to-date” with **all** of the service packs and security updates available for Visual Studio 2005. Using **Windows Updates** will ensure this. Or, just select **Help → Check for Updates** from inside of Visual Studio.

If the above requirements are not met, **Rhino4_d.exe** will not run. 

===== More Information =====
It is still possible to debug Rhino plug-ins without using **Rhino4_d.exe**. You can debug Rhino plug-ins using the **PseudoDebug** configuration.

The advantage of debugging your plug-in using the **PseudoDebug** configuration is that all other plug-ins will be loaded during the debugging session. This is because release Rhino, or **Rhino4.exe**, will load all release plug-ins. 

Also, **PseudoDebug** build work with the **Evaluation** version of Rhino. Thus, it is possible to use the Rhino evaluation version as a debugging platform.

The disadvantage of debugging your plug-in using the **PseudoDebug** configuration is that you cannnot debug into MFC, as this configuration links with release MFC libraries.
