====== Previews of Rhino files missing in Windows Explorer ======
> **Summary:** //How to make sure the Rhino thumbnail viewer is registered in Windows//

If you do not see preview thumbnails of Rhino .3dm files in Windows Explorer, it may be that the the shell extension, provided with Rhino, is not correctly registered with Windows. 

To register the shell extension, you'll need to have Administrator privileges in Windows. You can, from an 'elevated' command prompt (Run as Administrator), paste the following 

===Open the Command Prompt as Administrator in Windows 8 or 10===

Both Windows 8 and 10 offer a Power Users menu that you can access by pressing **Windows+X** or just right-clicking the Start button. On the Power Users menu, choose “Command Prompt (Admin).”

When you launch the Command Prompt with admin privileges, you’ll likely see a “User Account Control” window asking for permission to continue. Go ahead and click “Yes.”

**regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System\RhinoHandlers.dll"**

or

**regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\Rhino 6\System\RhinoHandlers.dll"**

and hit Enter.
