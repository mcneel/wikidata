====== Rendering Architecture in Rhino ======

**A place to learn how to render architecture**

This guide contains many tutorials we have found useful in creating photo-realistic rendering with Rhino.  It is one part of the [[rhino:architecture:home|using Rhino in Architecture series]].


=== Vray for Rhino in Architecture ===
Vray is the most popular high-end render engine for Architects on every software platform.  It is the tools of choice to create the best images. Go here to [[https://www.chaosgroup.com/vray/rhino|download Vray for Rhino 3.4 on Windows]]

Architecture consists of two main rendering types (Interior and Exteriors).  Each of the two types takes a distinctly different approach to rendering.  Learning two master both rendering types is important to understand how to get the  best images in all cases.  This guide is split into the two main types:

  * Getting Started Exterior Rendering
  * Getting Started Interior Rendering
  * Post Processing with PhotoShop
  * Tips and Tricks
  * Further Resources


A good place to start learning Vray for Rhino is the simple overview tutorial :

=== Getting Started Exterior ===
Of the most common architecture renderings exterior renderings are the most common and the easiest.  Understanding how to get good exterior renderings is the first step in learning how to render.

=== Getting Started Interior ===
Architectural interior rendering is the most difficult rendering style to do. Interiors rely on very specific lighting sources and a lot of indirect lights to be convincing.  Interiors can be difficult to setup and typically take much longer to render.  Mastering the interior rendering requires understanding a lot of tricks.
