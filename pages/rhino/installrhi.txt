====== Installing RHI Files for All Users ======
Rhino 5 and 6 allows you to select whether you want to install for one user or for all users on the computer. Also, the deployment of RHI files can be scripted to happen silently.

=====Deploying RHI Files for Rhino 6=====
  - Install Rhino 6
  - Run the command:

<code>"C:\Program Files\McNeel\Rhino Installer Engine\x64\rhiexec.exe" "C:\Full\Path\To\Installer.rhi" /admin /silent</code>

**/admin** installs for all users on the computer. **Note** you must run this from an elevated command prompt or account - the admin option will fail silently if the account doesn't have permissions to modify system-wide resources.

**/silent** installs without showing user interface.

=====Deploying RHI Files for Rhino 5=====
  - Make sure Rhino 5.6 or newer has been deployed on your network.
  - The command to run, all on one line, is:
    
<code>"C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System\x64\rhiexec.exe" "C:\Full\Path\To\Installer.rhi" /admin /silent</code>


**/admin** installs for all users on the computer. **Note** you must run this from an elevated command prompt or account - the admin option will fail silently if the account doesn't have permissions to modify system-wide resources.

**/silent** installs without showing user interface.
