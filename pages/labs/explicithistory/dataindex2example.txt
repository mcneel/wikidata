When accessing individual items in a list, one has to use an index value. The first item in any list if always stored at location zero, the second item at location 1 and so on and so forth. Typically, if you start to access a list at index -5, an error wil occur since no such location exists. However, some components that deal with indices have a Cycle option that remaps any index values onto the valid domain.

\\

This example shows how Cycle on/off behave differently.
