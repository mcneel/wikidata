> **Summary:** //A basic electric vector field solver for Rhino4//

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field|Wikipedia]] definition:

\\

In physics, the space surrounding an electric charge has a property called an electric field. This electric field exerts a force on other charged objects. The concept of electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday.

\\

The electric field is a vector with SI units of newtons per coulomb (N C^-1^) or, equivalently, volts per meter (V m^-1^). The direction of the field at a point is defined by the direction of the electric force exerted on a positive test charge placed at that point. The strength of the field is defined by the ratio of the electric force on a charge at a point to the magnitude of the charge placed at that point. Electric fields contain electrical energy with energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity. The electric field is to charge as acceleration is to mass and force density is to volume.

\\

A moving charge has not just an electric field but also a magnetic field, and in general the electric and magnetic fields are not completely separate phenomena; what one observer perceives as an electric field, another observer in a different frame of reference perceives as a mixture of electric and magnetic fields. For this reason, one speaks of "electromagnetism" or "electromagnetic fields." In quantum mechanics, disturbances in the electromagnetic fields are called photons, and the energy of photons is quantized.

=====Commands=====

Before a solution can be computed, you must add a number of charge objects to the document. You can either add them directly using the //ElectricPointCharge or //ElectricLineCharge commands, or you can tag existing points and lines as charge objects using the _ElectricCharge command.

\\

| //Setup commands// |
| Icon | Command | Description |
|    {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/ElectricChargeIcon_48.png}}    | _ElectricCharge | Assign a charge to an existing object |
|    {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/ElectricPointChargeIcon_48.png}}    | _ElectricPointCharge | Create a point charge object |
|    {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/ElectricLineChargeIcon_48.png}}    | _ElectricLineCharge | Create a finite line charge object |

\\

Once you have defined at least one charge object, you can run the solver. Before a solver begins it will ask you to select a number of active charge objects, all objects that are recognized as proper charge objects will be highlighted while the command is running.

| //Solver commands// |
| Icon | Command | Description |
|    {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/ElectricFieldGrid_48.png}}    | _ElectricFieldGrid | Compute field direction vectors for a grid of samples |
|    {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/ElectricFieldLine_48.png}}    | _ElectricFieldLine | Compute individual field lines using a ThroughPoint style interface |
|    {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/ElectricFieldSection_48.png}}    | _ElectricLineSection | Compute a number of equally spaced field lines |
|    {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/ElectricFieldVisualization_48.png}}    | _ElectricFieldVisualization | Start a potentially endless animation of charged particles that are spawn and influenced by the defined charges |
