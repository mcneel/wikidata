====== When Booleans Don't Work ======

\\

This is an example of a solid that cannot be constructed with solid primitives and unioned into one piece.

The main problem is the condition of the side surfaces that are coincidental and do not share a volume with the main solid piece. When Booleans fail, rely on using surface editing techniques described in the steps in the linked document.
