===== Display Troubleshooting: Intel Cards =====


The Intel HD series of graphics cards has been among the worst performing cards we've seen.
 
  * Some Rhino **Advanced Display** features appear to work on the 5000 series, but earlier models have  inadequate support for Rhino's display features. 
  * If Rhino detects a graphics card that is not capable of working well, the **OpenGL** option, **Advanced hardware acceleration**, will be automatically turned off. To check this, on the **Tools** menu, click **Options**, then **View**, and then **OpenGL**.
  * You should still be able to model, but added graphics features such as **shadows** in the **Rendered Display** mode, **texture** display and **anti-aliasing** of wireframes will not be available. 




**Is the problem solved?**
  * **Yes**. YAY!\\
  * **No**. [[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:NothingWorked|Now what?]]
