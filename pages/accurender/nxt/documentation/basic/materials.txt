====== Material Basics ======

=== Adding Materials to a Drawing ===

//Materials can be added to your drawing in many ways.  Here are a few//:

  * You can create a new material by using the dropdown button on the Materials tab of the nXt Palette.  Choose the appropriate template for your material.  The appropriate [[accurender:nxt:documentation:basic:material_editor|Material Editor]] will be invoked.  This material is stored in the current drawing only.

  * Using the Get Material from File button on the Materials Tab, you can import .nXtMaterial files for use in the current drawing.  Many material files are available for [[http://nxt.accurender.com/files/folders/material/default.aspx|download]].

  * You can drag and drop an .nXtMaterial file directly from explorer into your AutoCAD drawing.


=== Assigning Materials to Objects and Layers ===

Materials can be assigned to objects or layers in your drawing.  If you use AutoCAD Architecture(r) (formerly Architectural Desktop(r) or ADT) you can also assign materials to AEC components.

//There are many ways to assign a material to an object or layer.  Here are a few://

  * Drag and drop a material from the palette onto an object.  You will have the choice of assigning the material to the object or two the object's layer.
  * Select the material in question and use the Attach Material to Objects button.  This method allows you to assign materials to individual faces of 3dsolids by using AutoCAD's sub-object selection methods.

  * Drag and drop a material from the palette onto a layer in the Layer list.
  * Select a material from the palette.  Select one or more layers from the layer list.  Click the Attach Material to Layer button.

  * Drag and drop the material file from Explorer directly onto an object in your drawing.  This method allows you to add and assign a material in one operation.  You will be prompted to choose the object or the object's layer. 

=== Assigning Materials to ACA Components ===


nXt materials are just AutoCAD materials with some additional data attached to them.  //If you use AutoCAD Architecture (ACA) you can attach an nXt material in the same way you would attach an AutoCAD native material.// For example, using Style Manager, you can attach an nXt material to an AEC material using the following procedure:

  * Select your material under Multi-Purpose Objects->Material Definitions.
  * On the Display Poperties tab, click the Edit Display Properties button.
  * Use the Render Material popdown list to select your nXt material.  The nXt materials will have a prefix of "AccuRender-" before the material name.

=== Additional Notes ===

  * Use the AutoCAD //_PURGE// command to delete unwanted, unused materials from your drawing.  Materials in use cannot be deleted.
  * Material assignments by object take precedence over material assignments by layer.
  * Use the Remove Material from Objects button to remove materials assigned by object.
  * To remove a material assigned by layer, select the layer(s) from the Layer list and click Remove Material from Layers
