======Why Two Shortcuts?======
**You have finished installing Rhino V5 on your 64-bit Windows computer and you have two Shortcuts.**

The V5 installer installs both 32 and 64-bit versions of Rhino automatically. Each one has abilities and limitations the other does not.

**32-bit Rhino V5:**\\
  * **Advantage** - Rhino V5 32-bit can run plug-ins designed for V5 AND Rhino V4.
  * **Disadvantage** - 32-bit applications are limited to using a total of 4GB of memory, shared between Windoes and the application.

**64-bit Rhino V5:**\\
  * **Advantage** - Rhino V5 64-bit is not limited to 4GB of memory. It can use all of the memory installed in your computer.
  * **Disadvantage** - 64-bit V5 can not run plug-ins designed for Rhino V4. It must have plug-ins designed specifically for it.

**Do I need both?**\\
  * Maybe, maybe not.
  * If you're not sure leave both installed
  * If disk space is critical, perhaps on an SSD hard drive, you can uninstall the one you don't need.
    * If needed, you can uninstall either the 32 or 64-bit version of Rhino.
    * **Do not uninstall the "Rhinoceros 5 Help Media or Rhinoceros 5 Language Pack Installers**
