====How to save textures in 3dm files====
When saving a new 3dm file, the **Save textures** checkbox is available in the **Save** dialog box.\\ \\ {{:rhino:savetextures.png?400|}}
  ***Enable** the **Save textures** checkbox to embed images used by materials, environments, and decals into the 3dm file.
  ***Disable** this checkbox if you want the images linked externally. If the images are lost, they will be reported as missing when the 3dm is opened. A dialog box appears for relocating the images.
====How does Rhino find textures?====
When Rhino opens a 3dm file that refers to an image in a material, environment, or decal, it searches for these images in these locations:
    * The folder where the 3dm file is stored and its sub-folders.
    * The folders set in Options > Files > Search Paths and their sub-folders.
====What is the "<filename>_embedded_files" folder?====
When Rhino opens a 3dm, and the embedded images cannot be found on the disk. The embedded images will be extracted into the *_embedded_files folder in the same location as the 3dm file.
