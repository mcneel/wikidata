====== OpenNURBS 5 11-July-2013 ======

===== What's New =====

==== Extrusion Object Render Mesh Support ====

Rhino 5 SR6 began saving extrusion object render meshes in .3dm files and the 11-July-2013 opennurbs toolkit will read and write these meshes.  For developers using opennurbs to read .3dm files and display them, this means you handle extrusion objects (ON_Extrusion) the same way you handle polysurface objects (ON_Brep).

Earlier versions of Rhino simply calculated extrusion object render meshes as needed, did not save them in .3dm files and opennurbs toolkit users had to write their own extrusion object meshing code.
