=====Overview=====
The Rhino Application Platform (RAP) provides the tools for developers to wrap their application around Rhino by creating a custom //Skin//.

=====More Information=====
Rhino allows developers to customize most of Rhino's interface so that the application appears to be their own. We call this a custom //Skin//.

With a custom Skin, you can change the following Rhino features:

  * Application title
  * Application icon
  * Splash screen
  * About dialog box
  * Menu bar
  * Toolbars
