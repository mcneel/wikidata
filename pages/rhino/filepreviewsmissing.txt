====== Previews of Rhino files missing in Windows Explorer ======
> **Summary:** //How to make sure the Rhino thumbnail viewer is registered in Windows//

If you do not see preview thumbnails of Rhino .3dm files in Windows Explorer, it may be that the thumbnail viewer, provided with Rhino, is not correctly registered with Windows. 

To register the Rhino thumbnail viewer, you will need to open a Command Prompt as an Administrator.

====Windows 8 or 10====

To open a Command Prompt as Administrator on Windows 8 or 10:

  - Access by Power menu by pressing **Windows+X**
  - From the menu, select **Command Prompt (Admin)**

When you launch the Command Prompt with Admin privileges, you’ll likely see a **User Account Control** window asking for permission to continue. Go ahead and click **Yes**.

====Windows 7====

To open a Command Prompt as Administrator on Windows 7:

  - Click Start
  - In the search field, enter **CMD**.
  - In the results list, you will see **CMD**.
  - Right-click on **CMD** and from the context menu, select **Run as Administrator**.

When you launch the Command Prompt with Admin privileges, you’ll likely see a **User Account Control** window asking for permission to continue. Go ahead and click **Yes**.

====Register the Rhino Thumbnail Viewer====

==Rhino 6 for Windows==

If you have Rhino 6 for Windows installed, then run the following command from the Command Prompt window you just opened:

  regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\Rhino 6\System\RhinoHandlers.dll"

==Rhino 5 for Windows==

If you have Rhino 5 for Windows (and you don't have Rhino 6 for Windows installed), then run the following command from the Command Prompt window you just opened:

  regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System\RhinoHandlers.dll"

==== Note: ====
If you are running an older Windows, like Windows 7, you may need to run Windows **DiskCleanUp** utility. Only check "Thumbnails" to be deleted. Let it delete the Thumbnail cache. Then when you browse a folder, it will regenerate the image.
Some report that uninstalling a Rhino version, causes this issue. 
Running **Repair** on the Rhino are using should also work here, as well.
