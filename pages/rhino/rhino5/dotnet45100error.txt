====== Installing Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 failed (5100) ======
**Problem:**\\ So according to Microsoft, the 5100 return code is somehow related to system requirements.


**Solution 1:**\\ Reboot the computer.  If the a previous setup required a reboot and it has not happened yet. After the reboot, the .NET Framework 4 setup succeeded.

**Solution 2:**\\ Does the target system have enough hard disk free space? The .NET 4.0 minimum requirement is 2 GB disk space for installation. Free up space in the installation drive and installing it will work fine.
