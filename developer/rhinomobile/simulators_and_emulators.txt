======RhinoMobile - Simulators & Emulators======

> :!: **WARNING:** This wiki entry is a work-in-progress: Information may be missing or incomplete.

===== Android Emulators =====
Android Emulators are a decent approximation of actual devices themselves, though performance may vary slightly.  The Android Emulator does a good job virtualizing hardware configurations and failing when they should (you can limit the amount of memory, for example, in a way that is not possible with the iOS simulator).  That said, it's still important to test on actual devices, esp. given the functional limitations of the emulator (no multitouch, for example).

__**Rotation and Multi-touch**__*

  * **fn**+**control**+**F12** = Rotate Emulator (OS X)
  * **(left)control**+**F12** = Rotate Emulator (Windows)

*You cannot simulate multiple touches on the Android Emulator

__**Resetting an Emulator**__

It is rarely necessary to reset the Android Emulators as the entire app is removed between builds.  Should you need to reset it, the best way is to delete the entire AVD itself and create a new one from scratch.  Open the Android Virtual Device Manager (In Xamarin Studio, navigate to **Tools** > **Open Android Emulator Manager...** in the Application toolbar), in the **Android Virtual Devices Tab**, select the Emulator from the list of AVDs and click the **Delete** button.

===== iOS Simulators =====
The iOS Simulators are a convenient way to quickly test your app with multiple screen sizes, versions of iOS versions, and on different devices.  You can access the Simulator by running your app in Debug or Release mode and selecting a Simulator and Devices from the drop-down menu to the right.

> :!: **Warning:** Simulators are NOT a good substitute for testing on actual iOS hardware.  App behavior/performance on a device can vary substantially from the Simulator, esp. with OpenGL ES 2.0 code.

To install older versions of the iOS Simulator, launch Xcode, and navigate to **Xcode** > **Preferences** > **Downloads** tab > **Components** section > //click small download arrows// to the right of the Simulator version you wish to install.

__**Rotation and Multi-touch**__
  * **Command** + **Left/Right** arrow keys = Rotate the Simulator
  * **alt/option** + //move the cursor around// = Simulate two touches
  * **alt/option** + **Shift** + //move the cursor around// = Two-touch panning

__**Accessing Simulator File System**__

The best way to access the contents of the Simulator filesystem is to use a Terminal.  In OS X, open a terminal window and navigate to:

/Users/<you>/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/<ver>/Applications/<long app UDID number>/

(Remember you can use Tab to autocomplete paths as you change directories - useful for auto-completing the longer app UDIDs).

Alternatively, you can use Finder to navigate to the same folder, but you will have to change your Finder Preferences to show hidden files if you have not done so already.

For more information about where to store temporary or persistent resources, please check out the following [[http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/application_fundamentals/working_with_the_file_system/|Xamarin documentation]].

__**Resetting the Simulator**__

It is often necessary to clean out the entire contents of the simulator between builds, especially those builds in which you have modified or removed resources that may get cached on the simulator.  If you want a fresh start, you can reset the simulator to the virtual "factory settings by navigating to the **iOS Simulator** > **Reset Content and Settings...** in the Application menu.  Note that this deletes all app data as well as resets the App's UDID number.
