====== NVIDIA Quadro Video Issues ======
> **Note:** NVIDIA actively fixes issues and updates their drivers.  Please follow the instructions below to get the latest update. This can have a significant impact on the stability of Rhino.

These instructions are for computers that have NVIDIA graphics hardware. The instructions below will help you determine if your computer has NVIDIA graphics hardware and if the driver should be updated.  (The //driver// is software that the graphics hardware uses.)

=====Determine Computer Graphics Hardware=====
  - Start <color red>**Rhino**</color>.
  - On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
  - Expand the **View** tab (located near the bottom of the list on the left), and then click **OpenGL**.
  - In the **Implementation Settings** section, make sure **Use accelerated hardware modes** is checked.
  - Look in the **Video Hardware & Driver Information** section.
  - If description starts with "NVIDIA" and mentions "Quadro", then you have NVIDIA Quadro hardware. Continue on to determine the driver version.
  - If the first line does not say "NVIDIA Corporation" or the hardware description does not mention "Quadro", then these instructions to not apply to your computer.  Please read **[[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:failure|Video Troubleshooting Section]]** for additional things you can do.
 
=====Determine NVIDIA Driver Version=====
  - Start <color red>**Rhino**</color>.
  - On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
  - Expand the **View** tab (located near the bottom of the list on the left), and then click **OpenGL**.
  - Look for the **Driver Version:** line.  It will have a long number that looks like <color grey>x.xx.xxxx.xxxx</color> The last five digits of this number are the NVIDIA driver version. For instance, if the long Driver Version number is 8.17.0011.9713, then the NVIDIA driver version is 197.13.
 
If the NVIDIA driver version is equal to or larger than 340.66, then **stop**.  <color grey>(The driver is up to date as of August 2014.)</color>

If the computer has NVIDIA graphics driver version is less than 340.66, then update the driver by following the instructions below.


=====Instructions to update the NVIDIA Quadro driver=====

These instructions explain how to update the **Quadro** driver.  If you have GeForce hardware, go to the previous section.

=====Additional Quadro Performance Improvements=====

--> NVIDIA Threaded Optimization setting#

Many users are reporting random crashes with NVIDIA drivers.  There is a setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel that seems to help these problems.\\ 

>Note:**We recommend using the "Workstation App - Dynamic Streaming" setting**.
