**LISP Library for CAD Applications**

DOSLib is a library of LISP-callable functions that provide functionality not available in CAD-based LISP programming languages, included with AutoCAD and BricsCAD.

DOSLib extends the LISP programming languages, in these applications, by providing the following functionality:

  * **Drives** - Check for drives, change between drives, and check available disk space.
  * **Paths** - Manipulate path specifications.
  * **Folders** - Create, rename, remove, select, and change folders. Return special operating system folders.
  * **Files** - Copy, delete, move, rename, and select files; get directory listings, search and find multiple instances of files, and change file attributes.
  * **Print** - Get and set default printers, and spool print files.
  * **Configuration** - Manipulate Windows-style initialization (INI) files, and access the Windows Registry.
  * **Processes** - Run operating system commands or other programs.
  * **Interface** - Get strings, integers, reals, and lists from the user. Display Windows message boxes, progress meters, and splash screens.
  * **Strings** - Tokenize strings, extract characters, find characters, insert, remove, and replace characters, and trim characters.
  * **Math** - Trigonometric calculations, vector manipulation, statistical analysis, and more.
  * **CAD** - Save all and close all open files. Preview drawings and list xrefs.
  * **System** - Get system information, sort lists, change the system date and time, manipulate the keyboard, and play sounds.
