| **Hi ! Hydra** by Kai BAO [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] & Grasshopper.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/KaiBAO.zip|Download...]]// | {{:legacy:en:image002.jpg}} |  Currently the super high-rise building enjoys rapid development, rising from the level ground one by one. The super high-rise building is not only the breakthrough of land use restriction, but also the unfolding of the technology and even the glory of the city. Meanwhile, architectural ecology has got increasing attention. Architectural form and functional bionic became one way to secure enlightenment of natural ecology for architects. This design begins with Bionics, attempting to seek the new forms of super high-rise building. Contact //[[<ibund@126.com| dr. Chengyu SUN.]]//|>
| **Pavilion with soothing wind** by Junchao LV Grasshopper & Excel VBA.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/JunchaoLV.zip|download...]]//| {{:legacy:en:image004.jpg}} |  For skyscrapers, a comfortable balcony always seems impossible. But now, it’s not a dream anymore. With the research in aerodynamics and precise sunlight analysis, we designed a balcony system which provides a decent environment with moderate sunlight and soothing wind. This system provides a complex and reliable structural solution which fits all kinds of building types. Its great flexibility could even hold an urban lobby into the balcony! The weaving pattern of both inside and outside deliver the strength of the structure and an amazing architectural beauty. Contact //[[<ibund@126.com| dr. Chengyu SUN.]]//|>
| **Boundless Climb** by Zhu ZHAO [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] & Grasshopper.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/ZhuZHAO.zip|download...]]//| {{:legacy:en:image006.jpg}} | In the terms of composition, the student uses “volume” to reply Jinmao Tower’s emphases on “line” and Global Financial Center’s emphases on “plane”. In the terms of metaphor, the student uses “stacks of stone” in ancient Chinese Garden to reply Jinmao Tower’s metaphor of pagoda and Global Financial Center’s metaphor of “moon gate”. The conclusion of deducing, “volume” and “stacks of stone” remind the student the figure of Taihu Stone in ancient Chinese Garden. Thus, he finds the reference for the shape of his skyscraper.

| **Layered City** by Yeyao LIU [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] & Grasshopper.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/YeyaoLIU.zip|download...]]//| {{:legacy:en:image008.jpg}} | According to the basic principle of the VORONOI diagram, its intersection of the polygon is the farthest point compare with its basic point. Use the advantage point in the down-layer as their benchmark then to establish the road network in the up-layer and this make the disadvantage point which in the down-layer changed to be the advantage point in the up-layer. Under this method, the forming city of this superposition’s valuation has a dramatic rise in the space under the method of superposition. Contact //[[<ibund@126.com| dr. Chengyu SUN.]]//|>
| **Wind Tower** by Siwen XUE [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] & Grasshopper.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/SiwenXUE.zip|download...]]//|{{:legacy:en:image010.jpg}} |To face the problem of energy crisis in the future, the design tries to find a way of self-supplied energy for skyscrapers. Using the height superior of skyscraper, the design creates a green energy system which is a set of vertical wind mill. To fit the monsoon climate in Shanghai, the design ensures that each azimuth of the tower can absorb wind energy so that the electricity supply is continuous. The tower shape and the inside space can reflect the distribution rule of wind energy source. Using the wind-rose map and wind pressure-height curve to generate the shape.

| **Water Transfer** By Zhengwei LUO [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] & Grasshopper.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/ZhengweiLUO.zip|Download...]]//|{{:legacy:en:image012.jpg}} |Traditional sewage treatment plant not only takes up a large land area, it also isolates itself from visitors. In order to improve land area usage, bring the sewage treatment plant to the upper level of the building, and have the purification process run vertically from top to bottom. Having the sewage treatment tower at the upper levels attract tourists to visit, lets residence have a better understanding of the sewage purification process, and also serves as an observation deck. This type of [[rhino:architecture|Architecture]] mainly expresses strong properties of public service. Contact //[[<ibund@126.com| dr. Chengyu SUN.]]//|>

The use of aerodynamic knowledge and eco-technology made dedication on the layout of buildings, monomer form of the building and utilization of solar energy and wind power eco-energy. We are trying not only to improve the pedestrian level wind environment, but also to resume a pleasant public parks and green space. Contact //[[<ibund@126.com| dr. Chengyu SUN.]]//|>
