====== Differences between Windows Rhino and Mac Rhino ======
=== Mac-only user interface additions ===

There are a number of commands and features that are available only on the Mac version.  See [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/mac/userinterfacefeatures|this wiki page]] for details. 

=== Mouse ===

  * A two‑ or three-button mouse is recommended, but all operations are possible using a one-button mouse.
  * To duplicate right-mouse actions with a one-button mouse, hold down the **Control** key and click the mouse button.
  * In a drawing view, you can right-click and drag a 2D view to pan the drawing view. Clicking and dragging in a perspective view rotates the view. Both of these operations are the same in Windows and the Macintosh. If your mouse has a scroll wheel, then you can use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out in a view. This is also the same as the Windows version.

  * If you right-click anywhere in a view and release the button without moving the mouse, a context menu appears. A right-click in a view will not repeat the last command.

=== Right-Click Context Menu ===

  * Right-clicking in a viewport always displays a context menu and does not act as **Enter** to repeat the last command.  This can be changed by unchecking "Enable context menus" in Rhinoceros > Preferences > Mouse > Mouse.

=== Command Line ===

  * You can type commands in Mac Rhino - just start typing. A Command Search window instantly appears.

=== Toolbars and Tool Palettes ===

  * Mac Rhino has **//tool buttons//** that invoke Rhino commands in the standard Macintosh toolbar.
  * Mac Rhino also has **//tool palettes//**, which are windows containing a collection of tool buttons. \\  A tool palette of frequently-used tool buttons opens at the left of the document window when Mac Rhino starts..
  * Tool palette buttons can contain one or two commands and a menu..
  * Hover the mouse over a tool palette button to display the button's tooltip.\\  If the tooltip has two lines of text, the button contains a primary and an alternate command.
    * To invoke the **primary** command, click the tool palette button.
    * To invoke the **alternate** command, hold down the **Option** key and click the tool button. **Note:**  You can customize the mouse click actions for the tool bar in Rhino > Preferences > ToolPalette.
  * Tool palette buttons containing a menu have a small "disclosure triangle" in the lower left corner.
    * To open the menu, click the tool palette button and hold down the mouse button.
  * Tool palette menus can also be displayed as floating tool palettes.
    * To display a floating tool palette, hold down the **Option** key and click and hold down the mouse button.

=== Keyboard ===

  * Windows Rhino uses the **Control** key for many operations. On the Mac version, use the **Command** key instead.
    * For example, **Command** click replaces **Ctrl** click to deselect objects.
    * Also, the **Command** key replaces the **Ctrl** key for navigation shortcuts:

| **Key** | **Action** | **+ Command key** |
| **Left Arrow** | Rotate left | Pan left |
| **Right Arrow** | Rotate right | Pan right |
| **Up Arrow** | Rotate up | Pan up |
| **Down Arrow** | Rotate down | Pan down |

=== Mouse Navigation with Modifier Keys ===

  * Regardless of the view projection style, hold down the **Shift** key to always pan, hold down the **Command** key to always zoom, and hold down the **Command+Shift** keys to always rotate the view..
  * If you have a one-button mouse, you hold down the **Control**, **Command**, and **Shift** keys together to always rotate a view. \\  Easy viewport navigation is one of the best reasons for using a two- or three-button mouse.

=== Fun with Laptops ===

  * Sliding two fingers up or down on the trackpad of recent Macintosh laptops acts like a scroll wheel. In Mac Rhino, this zooms the current view in or out.  In Rhinoceros > Preferences > Trackpad, you can check the "Use two fingers to pan and rotate views" option to change this behavior.

A laptop keyboard does not have a separate **Home**, **End**, **PageDn**, or **PageUp** key, but the **fn** key in combination with other keys duplicates the key function..
  * Since laptops ship with a one-button mouse, a Bluetooth mouse such as the Logitech V270 is a useful addition.

| **Key** | **+ fn key** |
| **Up Arrow** | Page Up |
| **Down Arrow** | Page Down |
| **Left Arrow** | Home |
| **Right Arrow** | End |
| **Delete** | Delete |
