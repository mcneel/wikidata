=====Overview=====

**What is RhinoMobile?**
RhinoMobile is a C# .NET library for the development of 3D, cross-platform, mobile applications.  RhinoMobile - like RhinoCommon - is based on the Xamarin Mono framework, a fully-functional .NET runtime that works on Android, iOS and OS X.  RhinoMobile uses openNURBS (the 3dm NURBS library) and RhinoCommon  (the .NET SDK for Rhinoceros and Grasshopper) and handles file IO, gesture recognition and 3D display (OpenGL ES 2.0).

**Who should use RhinoMobile?**
Anyone interested in developing, prototyping, or just experimenting with 3D mobile development. If you want to develop in C# and target as many devices as possible, this is the library for you.  Though there are many good 3D libraries out there for games, none are focused on 3D modeling.  RhinoMobile seeks to fill that gap.  No experience with mobile development necessary...just familiarity with C# and .NET.
