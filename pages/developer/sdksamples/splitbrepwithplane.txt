=====Project details=====
This is a VB.NET 2005 project containing plugin source code for Rhino4. It is a complete command class with comments.

This command works as follows:

  - It asks the user to select a set of (poly)surfaces
  - It asks the user for 3 points that specify a plane
  - It calculates cutting plane surfaces through each BRep
  - It splits the BRep with the plane. If the split was successful, the old objects are deleted and the new ones are inserted.
