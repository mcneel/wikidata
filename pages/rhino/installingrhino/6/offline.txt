=====Rhino Offline Installation and Validation=====
//Applies to Rhino 6, 7 and newer.//

The Rhino installer is responsible for making sure your Windows installation has everything it needs to run Rhino. This includes the .NET framework and Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime redistributable packages. Because many computers already have these packages, they are not embedded in the installer. They are downloaded as needed during installation.

In order to install offline, however, you need to make sure these packages are available.
====Downloading Windows Packages For Offline Installation ====
From a computer with internet access:
  - Download and install Microsoft Window updates offline.(this is a critical step. Not doing this may result in Rhino failing to install.

=====Validating an offline installation=====
Rhino licenses must be validated before they can be used. For offline computers, you can perform license validation offline.

  - When you launch Rhino, you will be notified that Rhino is unable to connect to the validation server. {{ :zoo:validate01.png?direct&200 |}}
  - Click the button **"Get Validation Code Manually"**.
