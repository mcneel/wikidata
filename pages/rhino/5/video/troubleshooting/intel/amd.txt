======Video Troubleshooting: AMD Hybrid Graphics ======
Your computer has AMD Hybrid Graphics, but Rhino can't see that video card. Here's how to fix it:
  - Open Windows **Control Panel**
  - Go into the **Power Options** applet
  - Set your plan to "**High performance**"
  - Restart Windows
  - Start Rhino
  - Go into Rhino Options - View - OpenGL
  - Make sure the top option **Use accelerated hardware modes** is selected
  - Verify the "Video Hardware & Driver Information describes your AMD/ATI graphics card

We recommend you [[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:amd|update your video driver]] if you are having display problems and the driver is more than 3 months old.
