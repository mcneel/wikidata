> **Problem:** //Ar4 locks up [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] and ADT//
This can happen both when loading Ar4 or browsing in any of the managers.

> **Fix:** ////
In the C:\Program Files\AccuRender 4.0  folder you will find a file rpcshell.dll.

Rename it to:rpcshell.xxx

Open [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]]

This will keep AccuRender from finding this control and it will substitute the default Windows control for floaing dialogs.

When service release 1 is complete, this problem will problem.will be corrected.
