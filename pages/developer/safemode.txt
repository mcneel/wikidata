======Why use Safe Mode?======

A shortcut in the Rhino Program group opens Rhino in Safe Mode. Safe Mode is a troubleshooting tool that blocks OpenGL and plug-ins from loading. In Rhino 5, it also blocks loading of toolbars and the Render Development Kit plug-in (RDK). Normally, answer **Yes** to loading them. Safe Mode is a troubleshooting tool and is not intended as a working mode.
