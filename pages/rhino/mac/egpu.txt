====== Can I use an eGPU on my Mac? ======

Apple does not offer high performance GPUs in any of their computer models. To get better performance from your Mac, you can use an external eGPU with a much more powerful AMD GPU with more VRAM.

Note: you can not use an Nvidia adapter in the eGPU. Apple no longer supports them.

You'll need both the external eGPU and an AMD adapter.

There is a VERY important, somewhat hidden setting you need to make in MacOS in order to get it to work at all.\\

Note: this is a "per app" setting, and the option will not even appear unless the eGPU is connected, powered up, and has a GPU in it.
