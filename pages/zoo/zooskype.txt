====== Skype conflicts with Zoo Service ======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:zoo5|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses a port conflict with Skype and Zoo 5.//

===== Issue =====
When I restart my server, the Zoo 5 service does not start. When I check the Windows Event Log (Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Event Log), I can see that the Zoo 5 service logged an error:

<code>
The Zoo 5.0 service on the Local Computer started and then stopped.
Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by another
service or program.
</code>

Examining the details of the error, again in the Windows Event Log, the following is reported:

<code>
Address already in use by another process.
Run 'netstat -o -n -a' from a command line to find the conflicting
process ID, then look in Task Manager to find the name of that process.
</code>

Following the directions above, I was able to determine that the conflicting process was Skype.

===== Resolution =====
Launch the Skype user interface and then pick **Tools -> Options**.

In the Skype Options dialog box, select the **Connection** page. On this page, uncheck the **Use port 80 and 443 as alternatives for incoming connections** option.
