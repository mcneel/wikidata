=====Intro to Algorithmic Design=====

Learn the main differences between traditional 3D modeling and algorithmic modeling. (4 minutes):

=====01 Intro to Vectors=====

What are vectors and what do we need them for? In this video, Rajaa explains how vectors are a way of defining length and direction. Vectors help define, orient or move geometry in 3D modeling space. (4'19"):

=====04 Position Vectors=====

Learn why a position vector is a special case, how to find the coordinates for the tip point of a vector and why vectors and points can sometimes get confused. (4'55"):

=====05 Vectors vs Points=====

In this video, Rajaa explores the differences between vectors and points in the context of the 3D coordinate system. in a clear list of items. (2'11"):

=====06 Previewing Position Vectors=====

Learn how to preview a position vector in Grasshopper and how to calculate the tip point. (2'25"):

=====07 Unit Vectors=====

Learn about another special vector case: the unit vector. Learn how to visualize it in Grasshopper and how to turn any given vector into a unit vector.  (3'45"):

=====08 Vector Scalar Operation=====

In this video, Rajaa introduces the first of the six main vector operations: Scalar. Learn how to scale the length of a vector by a certain factor and how scaling a vector and setting the length of a vector are achieved in different ways.  (6'01"):

=====09 Vector Addition Operation=====

Learn how to add vectors and when it can be useful. Rajaa will also explain the average vector and how to find it when the vectors being added have different lengths. Then on to Grasshopper to get a visual feedback for vector addition.  (8'13"):

=====10 Vector Subtraction Operation=====

Learn how subtracting two vectors results in a third vector. As opposed to vector addition, changing the order of the vectors in a subtraction alters the result, giving you a fourth vector with opposite direction. Learn also how vector subtraction is used to create a vector between two points.  (12'27"):

=====11 Summary of Vector Operations=====

Learn the differences and similarities, in this side by side comparison of the three main vector operations: scalar, addition and subtraction. Rajaa also points out the difference between scaling a vector and using  the amplitude component.  (2'26"):

=====12 Vector Dot Product Operation=====

As opposed to the other vector operations, dot product returns a number. Learn what this number tells us when it is positive, negative or equal to zero. Rajaa will also explain other uses for this operation, such as calculating the projection length of a vector over another or how the result is equal to the cosine of the angle between two unit vectors.
