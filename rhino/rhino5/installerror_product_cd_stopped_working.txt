====== Install Error "McNeel Product CD Has Stopped Working" ======
**Problem:**\\ The Rhino 5 installer gets an error while installing from the CD or downloaded file. 
  * It stops specifically when it can't expand the contents of the installer, reverses the extraction and posts this message. 
  * It is likely an issue with the install splash screen but it does not appear on all systems. 
  * At this time, we can not determine the cause.
