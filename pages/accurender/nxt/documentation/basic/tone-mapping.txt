===== Tone-Mapping =====

Tone mapping is the process of converting the luminance data used by nXt into displayable or printable RGB pixels.

As you move your cursor over the nXt Rendering screen, notice the numbers on the status bar.  The Value fields show the actual data in the nXt image for the Red, Green, and Blue sub-channels.  The data is luminance, in units of candelas per meter squared (cd/m^2).  The first three Color fields show the resulting RGB colors produced after tone-mapping, and displayed in the image.  (The fourth Color field shows the Alpha, or transparency channel, which is used for compositing.)

The tone-mapping controls are located in the upper right corner of the render screen.  The Brightness control is the most important.  In nXt, you //cannot// control the overall scene brightness by boosting the intensity all of the light sources.  The automatic exposure adjustment built into the tone-mapping process will defeat this attempt. Adjust overall scene brightness by using the Brightness control.
