==== Crash starting Rhino from a desktop or Start menu shortcut ====

**Try:**\\
    * If **Rhino still crashes after disabling hardware acceleration**, the problem may be a **plug-in**.
      * **Restart in SafeMode**, and **Check** the box for **Use accelerated hardware modes**. 
      * In the Rhino menu: **Tools - Options - Plug-ins**, **Uncheck** the **Enabled** box for all of the plug-ins that did not ship with Rhino, and **Check** the box **Ask to load disabled plug-ins** at the bottom.
      * Close Rhino and start normally (not using SafeMode). 
        * **Answer No** to loading all of the plug-ins you disabled.

      * If **Rhino starts with some plug-ins disabled**, the problem is one of the disabled plug-ins. 
        * **Restart Rhino normally** and answer **Yes** to loading **one plug-in at a time** and No to the rest until you determine which one causes the problem.
        * When you have determined which plug-in causes a problem, go back to **Tools - Options - Plug-ins** and **Check the Enabled box** for all of the plug-ins that don't cause a problem.

      * If **Rhino crashes in SafeMode** or you can't resolve the problem with these methods, contact us at http://www.rhino3d.com/support for help.
