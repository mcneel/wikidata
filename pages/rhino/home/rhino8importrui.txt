====== Importing RUI and Custom Settings into Rhino 8 ======
{{ :rhino:home:rui_open.jpg?200|}}

==== 1. Import RUI Menu Files ====
If you are looking to import a //Rhino 6 or 7 RUI//, you can do that here in Rhino 8:
Go to **Options -> Appearance -> Toolbars** and pick the //File// menu and //Open//.
Navigate and select a Rhino RUI into Rhino 8.

In this section of Rhino 8, you can save and restore unique layouts of toolbars. 
This is part of the new UI system that is shared by both Rhino 8 for Windows and for Mac.

**WindowLayout** is also a command that you can type in.

==== 2. Alias Shortcuts ====
Aliases are in their own file. In //Rhino 6 or 7// you can go to **Options -> Aliases -> Export** to export an ini file.
In //Rhino 8//, **Options -> Aliases -> Import** to import this file.



==== 3. Keyboard Shortcuts ====

Rhino System options like Keyboard shortcuts, Modeling aids settings, Files settings and more can be saved from //Rhino 6 or 7// with the **OptionsExport** command.

In Rhino 6 or 7, type **OptionsExport** or choose it from the Tools menu, and write the ini file. 
In Rhino 8, type **OptionsImport** or choose it from the Tools menu, and import the ini file.

==== 4. Legacy Toolbar Files from Rhino 5 ====

The Toolbar file format .TB can not be imported directly into Rhino 8.
It is a legacy format that is no longer supported by Rhino 8 or newer versions. 

As a workaround, if you have Rhino 6 or 7 for Windows, you can import the Toolbar and save as a RUI.
This is located in Options -> Toolbars -> File.
{{:rhino:home:rhino7_save_rui.png?400|}}

  * In  **Rhino 8 Windows**, go the  **Options -> Toolbars -> File**, and open the RUI.
  * In  **Rhino 8 Mac**, go the  **Rhino 8 -> Settings -> Toolbars -> File**, and open the RUI.

If you //do not// have **Rhino for Windows versions 6 or 7** and you have Rhino 8, you can download a **legacy key** [[https://www.rhino3d.com/support/|here]] and and install Rhino 6 or 7. Download Rhino from Archives [[https://www.rhino3d.com/support/|here]].

However, if you have one or two .TB files that you need saved as .RUI files, email //tech@mcneel.com// and attach the files.  We are happy to help.
