====== Manually Uninstalling Rhino ======
//The following process applies to Rhino 4 and later (that includes Rhino 5, 6, 7.//
\\

=====Problem=====
During the startup, install or uninstall of Rhino, you get an error message like this:

//The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable.//
Click OK to try again, or enter an alternate path to a folder containing the installation package '<filename>.MSI' in the box below.

=====Cause=====
The Windows Installer cache cannot find a file or registry key required for uninstall. This is a common problem caused by the Windows Installer Service. The best solution is to use **Windows Install Clean Up** to thoroughly remove the previous installation. After you clean up the previous install, you will be able to reinstall Rhino and get a valid install.


=====Resolution - Steps 1, 2 & 3=====
Manually remove Rhino and the Windows Installer registration for the product.
You will need to have //Administrator privileges// on your computer to complete this.

====Run the Program Uninstall====
  - Close the Rhino application.
  - Go to Windows Search.
  - Type **App and Features** (or **Add and Remove** programs)
  - Find the **Rhinoceros x.0** program on the list, pick and select **Uninstall** button.

  
====Delete the Rhino install folder==== 
  - Browse to //C:\Program Files\//.
  - Delete **Rhinoceros 4.0** or **Rhinoceros 4.0 Evaluation**.
  
====Delete Registry Keys:====
  - Go to Windows Search and type **Registry Editor**.
  - Open the **Registry Editor**. 
  - Browse to //HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros//.
  - Delete the **x.0** Key. For example, Rhino 4.0, 5.0 or whatever version of Rhino you are removing.
  - Browse to //HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros//.
  - Delete the **x.0** Key. For example, Rhino 4.0, 5.0 or whatever version of Rhino you are removing.

====Optional====
You should only do the following procedures if uninstall fails from the **Apps and Features**.
