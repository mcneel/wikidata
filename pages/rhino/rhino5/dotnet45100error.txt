**Problem**\\ 

According to Microsoft, the 5100 return code is related to system requirements.


**Solution 1**\\ 

Reboot the computer. 

If the previous setup required a reboot, it may not have finished. After this reboot, the .NET Framework 4 setup should be installed.

**Solution 2**\\ 

Does the target system have enough hard disk free space? The .NET 4.0 minimum requirement is 2 GB disk space for installation. Free up space in the installation drive and installing it will work fine.
