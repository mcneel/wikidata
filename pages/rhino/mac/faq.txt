==== General ====

-->When will Rhino 5 for Mac be released?#

Very soon.  Please see [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/t/rhino-for-mac-release-candidate-1/20047|this post]].

<--

-->When it is released, how much will it cost?#

We have not yet finalized our pricing, but less than Rhino 5 for Windows.  There will be a pre-release promotional price for owners of Rhino 5 for Windows and limited-time post-release promotional price open to everyone.

<--

-->If I buy Rhino for Windows, will I get Rhino 5 for Mac free?#

No, however, owners of Rhino 5 for Windows will be able to take advantage of a discounted pre-release promotion, where one Rhino 5 for Windows license can be used to get a special price on one copy of Rhino 5 for Mac.

<--

-->After Rhino 5 for Mac releases, will there be Service Releases or Updates?#

Yes.  In fact, Rhino 5 for Mac updates will include both bug fixes as well as new features.  Features like Layouts and Worksessions, while not included in the initial release, are planned for subsequent updates.  Those who have purchased Rhino 5 for Mac will receive these updates at no additional cost.

<--

-->How is Rhino for Mac different from Rhino for Windows?#

  * Rhino for Mac's interface is significantly different from Rhino for Windows.
  * Rhino 5 for Mac does not yet support Plug-ins (though support is planned soon).  [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/t/when-will-plugins-be-available-in-rhino-for-mac/20369|More info...]]
  * Rhino 5 for Mac does not (yet) contain all the features of Rhino for Windows.  [[http://www.rhino3d.com/mac-feature-compare|More info...]]
  * Rhino 5 for Mac does not contain all the commands of Rhino for Windows.  [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/mac/rhino5wincommandsnotinrhino5mac|More info...]]

<--

-->Does the Rhino for Mac work in languages other than English?#

Yes. We currently support Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Japanese, and Korean.  Rhino for Mac uses the default language selection built into OS X. 

To use a language that is different from the OS X default, in the application menu:
  - Navigate to **Rhinoceros** > **Preferences...** > **Language**.
  - In the **Language** panel, under **Rhino Language**, select your preferred language.

<-- 

-->What is a WIP?#

WIP stands for Work In Progress.  It is our form of "beta," and it's often is released in parallel with a stable commercial release but the WIP contains experimental or half-finished features.  WIPs are generally available to any user who owns the commercial (or Edu) version of the software.  The WIP could be unstable, have bugs, and contain unfinished features.
<--

--> The WIP has a time limit. What happens when it expires?#

The expiration ensures that everyone is testing the latest version and not reporting problems that have already been fixed.  Before each RhinoWIP version expires, a new WIP will be available for you to you [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5B/wip|download]]. RhinoWIP checks for updates each time it starts and will notify you if a new version is available. A notice will also be posted on the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/category/rhino-for-mac|Rhino for Mac section]] of the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/|Discourse Forum]] each time a new RhinoWIP version is available.
