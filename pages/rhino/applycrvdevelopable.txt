====== Applying 2D Curves to a Developable 3D Surface ======



To apply curves from a developed 2D pattern back to the 3D surface, follow these steps:

  - Create a developed surface from the 3D surface using UnrollSrf  
  - Draw the 2D pattern on this surface to taste  
  - Use CreateUVCrv (or in V3, under bonus tools CreateUVCrvOnSrf) to make UV curves from the developed surface including the added curves  
  - ApplyCrv all of the curves created by CreateUVCrv back to the original surface
