=====Problem=====
I get "Error 1935. An error occurred during the installation of assembly "Microsoft.VC80.CRT, ..."

=====Cause====
The Microsoft C++ 2005 Redistributable Package has never been installed or failed in an earlier attempt. This is a problem with Windows and the Microsoft Redistributable Package, not with Rhino's installer. However the Rhino installer is unable to successfully finish as a result. Sometimes, it is only the 64-bit version of Rhino that will not completely install.


=====Answer=====
Manually install the Microsoft C++ 2005 Redistributable Package **[[http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=26347|Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update]]**. Note, the version of these assemblies are **8.0.50727.5592** or **8.0.50727.6195**.

  - **[[http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=26347|Go to the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update page]]**
  - Click the **Download** button. {{:rhino:c_2005redistributables01.jpg?500|}}
  - Download the vcredistx86.exe for 32-bit OS only.
  - Download the vcredistx86.exe and vcredistx64.exe for 64-bit OS. {{:rhino:c_2005redistributables02.jpg?500|}}
  - Go to download location and install the redistributable(s).
