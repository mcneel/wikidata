====== Problems saving AccuRender Materials ======



=====Problem:=====
When you try to save an AccuRender Material you get an error message saying "can't save in read only library" or "cannot save the new item in a non-AccuRender folder".

=====Solution:=====

  * "can't save in read only library". All the Material Library folders except the User library are by design write protected. So try to save the Material in the User Material folder. If that folder also gives this error message please go to: C:\Program Files\Common Files\McNeel Shared\AccuRender Libraries\Libraries on your computer. In this folder you should be able to find a file called user.mlib Right click on the user.mlib file and choose Properties. Please check that the Read only box isn't checked, if it is checked, uncheck it.
  * "cannot save the new item in a non-AccuRender folder". This problem usually occurs on Vista. The problem is as the message is saying that you are trying to save the material in a non-AccuRender folder. What you need to do is to make sure that when you get the Save As dialog box open you need to go in Save in: to My Computer > AccuRender Libraries > Materials > User. When you then press save, it should work.
