====== The importance of saving your custom work environment ======


If you have modified the default workspace file (**default.rui** for Rhino V5 or later, **default.tb** for Rhino 4) in any significant way, it is highly recommended that you save it under a new name. 

New installations or updates of Rhino can overwrite the default file, wiping out ALL your customization in an instant. Workspace files can also get corrupted under certain circumstances, with the same result. Using the command **ToolbarReset** will also replace the existing default file, and any customization made to it will be lost as well.

===== How to save your customizations: =====


Go to Tools > Toolbar Layout (or Options > Toolbars), highlight the default file in the upper right window, then hit File > Save As from the menu and give your modified workspace a new, recognizable name. You will now continue to use this file for your work.

Always do all your modifications on your custom workspace. It is recommended that you save this file somewhere else as well as a backup (preferably on another computer like all important documents). Think of how much time it will take you to re-create it if you lose it.

Installing Rhino updates or ToolbarReset will not affect your personalized workspace file.

==== Important ====


Make sure only one instance of Rhino is open when making toolbar/Workspace modifications! Once done with your toolbar installations, make sure you use File>Save from the toolbar layout dialog to save your changes! Or, exit Rhino and re-open. Rhino saves toolbar changes automatically on exit. If you have multiple instances of Rhino open, the last one to close will overwrite the previous one, so you might lose your changes.

====Settings not included in Rhino workspace files====

The workspace file only contains information related to toolbars, not to other Rhino options.  For a complete overview of where all the Rhino options are stored and how to back them up/transfer them, [[SettingsTransfer|see this page]].

The above info applies to Rhino V5 and earlier, some of it may change for future versions.
