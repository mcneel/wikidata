====== The Material Tree ======
The Material Tree allows the user to combine two "parent" materials based on a specific method, creating a complex "child" material. Two "child" materials can be combined in the same way, yielding a more elaborate material. The methods for combining two materials are:
  * **Marble.** Consists of alternating slabs of vein and base materials. This is a 3D pattern defined for all points in space.
  * **Granite.** Produces a spotted pattern. The spots are solid pockets of material embedded in a base material.
  * **Wood.** This combination method produces concentric cylinders of alternating base and ring material. For realistic results, it is important to map correctly.
  * **Blend.** This is a simple option to combine two base materials and control the proportion of each one.
  * **Angular Blend.** This blends two materials from different viewing angles. It is useful for materials that are reflective at glancing angles and not reflective at 90 degrees. However, Fresnel effects are a physically-based way of producing similar effects.
  * **Tile.** This is a 2D procedure that combines two materials - one as a tile and the other as the joint between tiles.
  * **Fractal.**

Depending on which procedure is selected, different controls are available to the user. Marble, Wood, Granite, and Fractal all draw from the same set of controls. They are:
  * **Feature.** The ratio between base and stripe, spot, or ring is accessed through this control. It varies between 0 and 1. Lower values mean a higher ratio of base to feature.
  * **Blend.** This controls how much partial combination of the two materials occurs.
  * **Bump.** Creates the appearance of bumpiness. It ranges from -1 to 1. Negative values make the base appear concave, while positive values make it appear to stick out.
  * **Turbulence.** This is available for only marble and wood. It determines how chaotic the features are. A value of 0 produces perfect rings. Higher values distort and twist these rings.
  * **Octaves.** 
  * **Absolute Value.**
  * **Veneer.** This checkbox applies a 2D surface veneer instead of a 3D blend of materials.
  * **Scale.**
