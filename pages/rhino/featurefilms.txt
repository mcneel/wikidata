  * [[http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/flightplan/|more...]]

  * {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/flightplan.jpg}}
  * Almost the entire aircraft to some extent, minus the galleys and cargo hold (although in some cases [nose cone, attic], rough shape + size models where generated, then broken off to others [hand drafters] to complete the construction documents). Ext. of aircraft, including a HD-SLA grow for the toy plane prop. The inclusion of blocks in Rhino version 3 made the process of modeling the interior much easier, as I could keep separate files of the window panels, center panels, isle panels, and seats as separate files. As each component changed, I just changed the respective file, then updated the master, which would update all 72 rows of the plane (upper and lower decks, in case you were wondering how 72 rows could fit in a plane) in one shot.

  * [[http://flightplan.movies.go.com/index_main.html|New **Sneak Peek**!]] Be sure to check out the Trailer link, then click on "Watch a Sneak Peek" to see some great footage of the plane. Also, the Rhino model will soon be showing up under the "Explore Aalto Air E-474"

  * **Be sure to stick around for the end credits:** Not only to see all the people who labored on the film, but the model they flip all around behind the credits was almost entirely build in Rhino (really the only exception is the interior of the engine, I know they aren't build like that ;)  ) then passed to Maya for meshing and surface destruction. Also, a lot of the TV promo spots used this model to render out some of the high contrast interior shots.

=====Fantastic Four (2005)=====

All town signage statues, Parts of transformed house. Rhino was used heavily in both the modeling, then to section the models up (typically every 2'-0") The section were then plotted full size, where the sculptors transferred that to bead foam for carving. The bead foam is then given a hard coat, then painted, gloss, and believe it or not, it is at that point walkable!
