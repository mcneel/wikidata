** How do I transport an AccuRender 4 model and it's materials to another computer?  **

There is not a great way to do this in Ar4. The new ArNXT stores materials in file because of this problem.
That said, you can use the AutoCAD eTransmit command. It will embed all the custom materials in the file.
It does not embed is decals (textures) or decals on the objects.
You will need to move these image files to the new machine and duplicate the same directory locations so the material assignments can find them.
That can be hard if your decal images are all over the place!
You can add search paths to the new locations of these decals to the paths in Options -> AccuRender -> Path -> General Search path to make that a little easier.
