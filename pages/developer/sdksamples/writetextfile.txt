=====Question=====
I need to write to a text file from my general utility plug-in. Is this possible?
=====Answer=====
Sure it is  possible. But, the Rhino SDK does not have any special functions or classes to help you read or write text files.

With that said, there are a few ways to read and write text files in C++.  

  - Use the C-runtime library's **fopen**, **fputs**, **fwrite** and **fclose** functions.
  - You can use the iostream library's **ofstream** class.
  - You can use Win32's **CreateFile**, **WriteFile**, and **CloseHandle** functions.
  - You can use MFC's **CFile** and **CStdioFile** classes.

Check [[http://msdn.microsoft.com|MSDN]] or [[http://www.google.com|Google]] any of the above topics for an example.

=====Example=====
Here is a simple example that uses the C-runtime library.

<code c++>
/*
Description:
  Writes a string to a text file
Parameters:
  text     - [in] The string to write
  filename - [in] The name of the file to write. If the file does not
                  exist, it will be created. If the file does exist,
                  it will be overwritten.
Returns:
  true if successful, false otherwise.
*/
bool WriteStringToFile( const wchar_t* text, const wchar_t* filename )
{
  bool rc = false;
  if( (text && text[0]) && (filename && filename[0]) )
  {
    FILE* fp = _wfopen( filename, L"w" );
    if( fp )
    {
      size_t num_write = wcslen( text );
      size_t num_written = fwrite( text, sizeof(wchar_t), num_write, fp );
      fclose( fp );
      rc = ( num_written == num_write );
    }
  }
  return rc;
}
