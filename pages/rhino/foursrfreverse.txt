====== Mitch's First Fillet Problem ======

> **Summary:** //Here's an example sent in by Mitch Heynick.  Mitch writes: Fillet all vertical edges and the base with a radius of 10.  Fillet the horizontal inside ones near the top at 5. --Mitch//
Note: V5 FilletEdge handles this correctly if all the edges are filleted at once.
