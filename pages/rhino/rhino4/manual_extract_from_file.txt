===== Uncompressing a Downloaded Rhino 4EXE and Manually Installing =====

There are a few systems that, for some reason, object to the .png file format that we use in the V4 installation screen, and therefore cannot show the installer properly. If this is the case for you, please try this workaround:

  - Download the [[http://www.7-zip.org/|7Zip]] application and install on your system.
  - Right click on Rhino 4 installer file.
  - From the menu, select "**7-Zip**" and "**Extract files...**".
  - Select file location to extract the contents to and make a note of it.
  - Browse to this folder and look for the **Rhinoceros** subfolder.
  - Look for **Rhino4_Setup.msi**. Double-click to run this file to install V4.

The same process for **V5** is described [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/rhino5/manual_extract_from_file|here]].
