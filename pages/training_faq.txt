====== McNeel Training Overview ======

McNeel offers a variety of training options that include on-site, online and customized classes.
With the exception of customized training, McNeel courses are based on our Level 1 and Level 2 training guides. The training guides are not tutorials but class notes to accompany the instructor-led training. 
You can prepare for the class by downloading the evaluation software (if you do not already have it) and reviewing the outline and guide for your class. By doing this, you will be well on your way to learning Rhino before taking your training.

==== Online Training ====
McNeel also offers online training for Rhino users via distance learning technology that makes you feel like you are sitting right next to the instructor.  While there is no substitute for classroom, in-person training, the convenience of online training is unrivaled. It can be a great way to start using Rhino, Grasshopper and Brazil in a convenient and cost effective way. 

Videos of each session are posted to a private vimeo album. Videos can be streamed for up to 3 months or downloaded on your computer for indefinite use.

With online training, you may learn Rhino at your own schedule and your own pace, from the convenience of your desktop or mobile device. Online sessions are recorded and uploaded for you to review and build skills after the training has ended.

**Any Time - Any Where**
Because the online classes are recorded you may start a training session at any time. Just sign up for the next session, and email [[mary@mcneel.com|Mary Fugier.]] The typical cancelation policy is 48 hours or 2 days before the orientation session. If you waive the option to cancel, you can get the videos of the previous training session immediately for no additional charge. //**This option gives you immediate on-demand training.**//
 
Online training is also an outstanding option because you can:
  - Prepare for the live training with the videos of the previous session
  - Attend the live training
  - Download video also of the live training sessions. 
//All three options for the cost of one online training class!//

**Time Restrictions**
In addition, you are not required to be available for every online training session. You may need to arrive late, or leave early; the online training format can accommodate your limitations. 

Since the sessions are recorded, online training is also good option for existing Rhino users who wish to explore a Rhino or a plug-in they have not used in the past.

A: //Level 2 assumes Level 1 proficiency. Download and review the Level 1 and Level 2 materials above, and see which one best fits your current skill level.//

**Q: I´m looking for an online course in the next few months.  Is there a possibility to start the course a little bit sooner?** 
A: //If you register for an online class, and waive the option to drop, we can release the videos and class materials from the previous class for your study and preparation. You will get the videos from the previous class, the live class and the videos from the live class. The videos are posted to a private video album for you to steam or download to your computer.//

**Q: My connection to Internet is not good at the moment, but would like to know if I could watch the online sessions later on if I were to have troubles.**  
//A: Yes, all sessions are recorded and posted for streaming or download from a private vimeo album.//

**Q: Would you provide the link to download the version that is going to be used in the Rhino class?**

**Q: Can I use the Rhino for OSX beta for the training?**
//A: The Rhino for OSX is not acceptable for a Windows Rhino. Also Windows emulators, like VmWare and Parallels are not a supported Rhino platform and are generally not adequate for training. //
