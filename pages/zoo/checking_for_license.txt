====== How often does the Zoo check for a Rhino key? ======

If Rhino obtains a licenses from a LAN Zoo, it will "ping" that Zoo every 5 minutes to let the Zoo know it's still alive.
  * The Zoo never checks for a key...
  * Rhino gets a key from the Zoo, and tells the Zoo it's still using it
  * Communication is //always// initiated from Rhino. The Zoo will never initiate a conversation with Rhino.
