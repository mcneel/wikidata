====== Why can't I right-click to repeat the last command? (Rhino 5 for Mac) ======
> **Summary:** //It is possible to use right-click to repeat.  It takes chaning some settings.//

=====Problem=====
Unlike the Windows version, Rhino for Mac does not repeat the last command with a mouse right-click.

=====Answer=====
You can, by disabling the Context menu, which allows the repeat behavior.

  - On the menu, click **Rhinoceros** and then click **Preferences**.
  - Select the **Mouse** panel.
  - In the **Right Mouse Button** section, clear the **Enable Context Menus** check box.
