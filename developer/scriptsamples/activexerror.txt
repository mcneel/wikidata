======Error "ActiveX component can't create object"======
> **Developer:** //[[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]]//
> **Summary:** //Error "ActiveX component can't create object" returned when executing a script on 64-bit Rhino 5.//

=====Problem=====
A script which runs on a 32-bit version of Rhino 5 returns a **ActiveX component can't create object** error when executed on a 64-bit version of Rhino 5.

=====Cause=====
The script was trying to create a reference to an ActiveX (COM) object using VBScript's **CreateObject** method.

The 32-bit version of RhinoScript can create and use 32-bit COM components only, and the 64-bit version can create and use only 64-bit COM components.
