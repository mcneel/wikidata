What is 3D Printing?

The terms 3D printing and Rapid Prototyping (RP) are terms that covers a variety of processes which are aimed at quickly creating physical parts from 3D computer models using computer controlled machines. Virtually all RP processes are additive, that is to say the part is built up by adding, depositing, or solidifying material. This is the opposite strategy of a subtractive process such as machining, which creates objects by removing unwanted material from a large block in the form of chips. This article concentrates on preparing models for the 3D Printing Process.
