====== Ordinate Dimensions ======
**Question:**
How do I place the corner for the Ordinate Dimension?

The approach that Rhino takes is to create these ordinate dimensions in the active detail or on the model.
  * The ordinate dimension uses the //current cplane//.
  * You can set the cplane origin to the corner of the geometry that you will be dimensioning to.
  * To make a construction plane, use the [[https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/8/help/en-us/commands/cplane.htm#(null)|Cplane]] command with the 3PT option or other preferred options.
  * Use **NamesCplanes** to save your **cplane** and restore the cplance for additional dimensions or editing.

  * The layout arranges details that contain views of your objects and ordinate dimensions.
  * If you need to edit the location of the geometry, make the cplane active before moving the geometry.
