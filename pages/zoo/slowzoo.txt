=====Question=====
The Zoo application running on my server seems to be running slowly. When I check the Zoo's log file, I see a number of **Failed to write to client mailslot** errors. What could cause this?

=====Answer=====
This is a known bug that occurs when a Rhino client has checked out a license and then the client has gone offline (the computer has been removed from the network). This bug has been fixed in the [[http://download.rhino3d.com/download_rel.asp?rel=420|currently available Zoo]].
