====== What is a Zoo Plugin? ======

> **Summary:** //Overview of plug-ins for Zoo 5.0//

A Zoo plugin is a software module developed by a third party that extends the functionality of Zoo 5.0 by letting it validate product licenses.

===== More information =====
The Zoo lets you share licenses, or CD-Keys, among users. Before Zoo 5.0, the only licenses shared by the Zoo were from McNeel-based products (i.e., Rhino, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, and Bongo). With Zoo 5.0, third party Rhino plugin developers can now add support for their products to the Zoo.

When Rhino and Rhino-based products are installed as workgroup nodes instead of stand-alone nodes, licensing works like this:

  * When a workgroup node starts, it requests a license from the Zoo.
  * An unused license is assigned to the node.
  * When a node shuts down, the license is returned to the Zoo's license pool.

=====What is required to build a plugin?=====
Zoo plugins are .NET Framework 4.0 assemblies. So, to create a plugin for Zoo 5.0, you need one of the following development tools:

  - Microsoft Visual C# 2010
  - Microsoft Visual Basic .NET 2010

Also, all plugins that use the Zoo license system must be signed with an Authenticode certificate issued by McNeel Plugin Security. These certificates are free but must be requested by each developer. Developers must agree to the //Terms of Use// before a certificate is issued.
