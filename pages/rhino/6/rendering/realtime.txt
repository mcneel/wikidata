=====Overview=====


Rhino 6 includes advanced realtime rendering modes. Use these modes to create quick high-quality renderings for design presentation.  For a basic understanding of realtime rendering in Rhino V6 watch this video:

=====Setting up a rendering=====

=====Additional render settings=====

There are many setting that can be changed to improve the rendering. Take a tour through some of the settings beyond the defaults. 

===Environment===

If you do not like the reflections or would like to see the model in a different scene, change the environment.

===Groundplane===

Rhino 6's new groundplane features can really create a good based to build your rendering from.

===Snapshots===
