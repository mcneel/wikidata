====== Customizing User Library Locations ======

=====The Problem=====

AccuRender 4 users can create custom libraries in folders that are located on a network or removable Flash/USB type drive.  This allows them to work on many machines and always have their custom materials available. This is important to students that can not leave custom materials on lab machines because they will be lost in a restore or reloading of the lab machines.
