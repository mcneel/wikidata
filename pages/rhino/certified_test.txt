Certification exams measure knowledge and competency with 
Rhino software. The exams can be offered in a professional setting administered by a company's representative or in a non-proctored environment for self-evaluation.

Certifications are simply a way to test knowledge and competency in Rhino software and in 3D visualization. Typically, proficiency with these Rhino skills allow Rhino users to excel and develop more advanced skills, build a greater understanding of advanced concepts and continue advancing in their knowledge of 3D visualization.
