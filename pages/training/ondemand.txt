====== On-Demand Training for Rhino 6 ======
We do not have On-Demand videos specifically for Rhino 6. 
However, you may use the Rhino 5 On-Demand videos with a few exceptions.

  * We have some free [[https://vimeo.com/showcase/6192819|Rhino 6 Level 1 training]] videos. //More coming...//

  * Rhino 5 Level 1 On-Demand does work for all the exercises and modeling information. For the specific details on **Rhino 6 UI and Rhino 6 render** see this free [[https://vimeo.com/showcase/5007910/video/400789146|Rhino 6 Getting Started video]] and other Rhino 6 [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/6/trainingguides/en|Getting started presentations]].  

  * Our [[https://vimeo.com/ondemand/24822|Rhino 5 Level 2 On-Demand]] course was presented with Rhino 5, but works with Rhino 6. Advanced Surfacing and NURBS topology is the same in all releases of Rhino.
