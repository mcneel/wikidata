| {{:legacy:en:PocketStart.png}} | Original part. Note curved floor in the pocket. |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:Pocket1.png}} | Extract floor surface. Offset 4 units (Fillet radius). Pipe the top edge curves (cap = no) to the same radius. Intersect the pipe and the offset. |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:Pocket2.png}} | Pipe the resulting curves at 4. |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:Pocket3.png}} | This is the desired surface. Trim to taste with the top edge curve and an isocurve that lies on the floor. |

\\
