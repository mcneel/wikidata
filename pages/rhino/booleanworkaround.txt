======When Booleans Don't Work======
This is an example of a solid that can not be constructed with solid primitives and unioned into one piece.

The main problem is the condition of the side surfaces that are coincidental and do not shared a volume with the main solid piece. When Booleans fail, rely on using surface editing techniques as described in the steps in the linked document.
