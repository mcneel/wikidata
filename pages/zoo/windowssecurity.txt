===== Discussion =====
In case other people run into the same problem, we wanted to give you a heads-up that a recommended Windows Security setting interferes with activating licenses in Zoo. 

This particular case involved Windows Server 2012 R2. However, Windows Server 2016 and 2019 should be affected in the same way.

In this case, this Windows Registry value was preventing customers from activating our new Rhino licenses:

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\KeyExchangeAlgorithms\PKCS
Name:  Enabled
Type:  REG_DWORD
Value: 0x0
</code>

Internet Explorer was also failing to connect to //api.mcneel.com//, but Firefox was working, which helped narrow down the scope of the problem. Setting the **Enabled** value to **0xffffffff** (or deleting it) is enough to get things working again.
