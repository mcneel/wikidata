===== Android Devices =====

In order to debug your code on an Android device, you must enable USB debugging on the device.  This mode makes your device somewhat more vulnerable to damage - from you and from others - so it should be used with caution.  You can enable and disable it between development sessions if you like.

__**Android 4.0 (JellyBean - API 14) or higher devices**__

Enable the **USB Debugging** option under **Settings** > **Developer options**.

For Android 4.2 and newer, **Developer options** is hidden by default; use the following steps:

  - On the device, go to **Settings** > **About <device>**.
  - Tap the **Build number** seven times to make **Settings** > **Developer** options available.
  - Then enable the **USB Debugging** option.

> :!: **Tip:** You might also want to enable the Stay awake option, to prevent your Android device from sleeping while plugged into the USB port.

__**Kindle Fire Devices**__

On the device, select //Settings > Security// and set //Enable ADB// to //On//.
