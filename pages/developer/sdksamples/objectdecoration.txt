====== Adding Arrowheads to Curves ======
====== C++, .NET ======
> **Version:** //Rhino 4//

=====Question=====
Is there a way to add an arrowhead to a line using the SDK?

=====Answer=====
Arrowheads can be added to any curve object by simply modifying the curve object's attributes, or ON_3dmObjectAttributes. By modifying the attribute's m_object_decoration field, you can specify arrowheads on the start, end, or both ends of a curve object. The following example code illustrates this.

===== C++ =====
<code c++>

CRhinoCommand::result CCommandTest::RunCommand( const CRhinoCommandContext& context )
{
  // Define a line
  ON_Line line;
  line.from = ON_3dPoint(0, 0, 0);
  line.to = ON_3dPoint(10, 0, 0);

  // Make a copy of Rhino's default object attributes
  ON_3dmObjectAttributes attribs;
  context.m_doc.GetDefaultObjectAttributes( attribs );

  // Modify the object decoration style
  //attribs.m_object_decoration = ON::no_object_decoration;
  //attribs.m_object_decoration = ON::start_arrowhead;
  //attribs.m_object_decoration = ON::end_arrowhead;
  attribs.m_object_decoration = ON::both_arrowhead;

  // Create a new curve object with our attributes
  context.m_doc.AddCurveObject( line, &attribs );
  context.m_doc.Redraw();

  return CRhinoCommand::success;
}

===== C# =====
<code c#>

public override IRhinoCommand.result RunCommand(IRhinoCommandContext context)
{
  // Define a line
  OnLine line = new OnLine();
  line.from = new On3dPoint(0, 0, 0);
  line.to = new On3dPoint(10, 0, 0);

  // Make a copy of Rhino's default object attributes
  On3dmObjectAttributes attribs = new On3dmObjectAttributes();
  context.m_doc.GetDefaultObjectAttributes(ref attribs);

  // Modify the object decoration style
  //attribs.m_object_decoration = IOn.object_decoration.no_object_decoration;
  //attribs.m_object_decoration = IOn.object_decoration.start_arrowhead;
  //attribs.m_object_decoration = IOn.object_decoration.end_arrowhead;
  attribs.m_object_decoration = IOn.object_decoration.both_arrowhead;

  // Create a new curve object with our attributes
  context.m_doc.AddCurveObject(line, attribs);
  context.m_doc.Redraw();

  return IRhinoCommand.result.success;
}
