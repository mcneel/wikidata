====== Introduction to Daylight ======

==== Notes and Tips ====

The sun is 93 miles away from earth and the solar radiation reaching the earth’s atmosphere
remains relatively constant throughout the year at 1367 W/m2 (433 Btu/ft2). However, the
length of the atmosphere the sun rays travel, the cloud cover, and atmospheric turbidity has a
significant impact on the amount of direct and diffuse solar radiation reaching to earth’s surface
(Stein et al., 2006). The orientation and the slope of a surface, the neighboring structures that
block and/or reflect solar rays will further impact the amount of radiation received on a given
surface.

The key to successful daylighting design is to bring controlled amount of daylight into a space.

 Shading systems provide the single most
effective strategy for façade designs to achieve visual and thermal occupant comfort along
with building energy efficiency. 

Below are few different approaches to shading devices. They
are grouped here based on their design criteria; but the categorization also reflects on the
chronological development and the advancement of the shading system design and evaluation
techniques.

There are varieties of tools and simulation programs with different modeling capabilities.
Crawley at al. published a study that compared capabilities of twenty different building
performance simulation programs some of them are still used nowadays (BLAST, BSim, DeSTm
DOE-2.1E, Ecotect, Ener-Win, Energy Express, Energy-10, EnergyPlus, eQuest, ESP-r, IDA ICE, IES
VE, HAP, HEED, PowerDomus, Sunrel, TAS, TRACE, TRYNSYS) (2006). These tools are used with
varying degrees in architectural practices. There are two main simulation engines, namely DOE2
and Energy+. Figure 27, 28 shows a brief history of the development of the simulation engines,
and the software that utilizes these engines particularly among architects.
