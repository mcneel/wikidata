===== Display Troubleshooting: Intel Cards =====


The Intel HD series graphics cards series has been among the worst performing cards we've seen.
 
  * Some Rhino **Advanced Display** features appear to work on the 5000 series, but earlier models have  inadequate support for Rhino's display features. 
  * If Rhino detects a graphics card that is not capable of working well, the **OpenGL** option, **Advanced hardware acceleration**, will automatically turn off. To check this, on the **Tools** menu, click **Options**, then **View**, and then **OpenGL**.
  * You should still be able to model, but added graphics features such as shadows in the **Rendered Display** mode, texture display, and anti-aliasing of wireframes will not be available. 




**Is the problem solved?**
  * **Yes**. Yay!\\
  * **No.** **Copy** and **paste** the following text into an email to //tech@mcneel.com//:

| | |I followed the steps in the Video Troubleshooting wizard and determined that my computer has an Intel graphics system. **Use accelerated hardware modes** is turned off, but Rhino still has display problems.|
