> **Note:** //AccuRender 4 Network Rendering must be enabled during the AR4 installation to do the following configuration.//

AccuRender can render single frames in a distributed way over the network. This means you can use many computers that have a copy of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] and AccuRender 4 installed to contribute to rendering [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/accurender2_JH__1_.pdf|... go to PDF]]
