====== Overlapping boxes ======
> **Summary:** //One of the rules when using FilletEdge" is exactly 3 surfaces must meet at a point.  In this example, there are four surfaces to deal with.//

\\

| {{:legacy:en:How_to_tutorials/Fillets/OverlapBoxes/OverlapBoxes2.png}} | Use FilletEdge, radius .25, to get most of the work done.  |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:How_to_tutorials/Fillets/OverlapBoxes/OverlapBoxes3.png}} | Extract the four fillet surfaces from one corner and untrim one crossing pair. |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:How_to_tutorials/Fillets/OverlapBoxes/OverlapBoxes4.png}} | Use FilletSrf with a radius of 0.25, to create a fillet between the untrimmed pair. |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:How_to_tutorials/Fillets/OverlapBoxes/OverlapBoxes5.png}} | Trim and delete the extra surface pieces. |
