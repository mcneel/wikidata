===== Test your Plug-in =====
Be sure to run release compiles of 32- and 64- bit builds of your plug-ins in the 32- and 64-bit release candidate builds of Rhino 5.0 from VS 2010.

Also, ask a few of your more technically competent customers to download and install the Rhino 5.0 release candidates, as well as your new plug-ins.

Be ready for an official release on March 29th 2010.
