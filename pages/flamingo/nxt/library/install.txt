====== Flamingo nXt 5 Library Install ======
> **Summary:** //Library Install Location for Flamingo nxt 5//

===Material Library Download===
Each time Flamingo runs it checks to see if the libraries have been installed and if they are the current version, if not then the current version is downloaded and installed. 

The libraries will not be visible until they have been downloaded and installed which means you have to have Flamingo loaded once long enough for the download to complete before anything will appear. 

  * The libraries can be manually downloaded from [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.na.mcneel.com/flamingo/nxt/5.0/libraries/20151105_100942-en-us-libraries.msi.|here.]]  
  * Flamingo should be trying to download and located the materials here **C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Flamingo nXt\Libraries\Installers\en-us\5.0.2015.1105.** 
  * If you look in this folder on your computer you should see two files, download_log.xml will contain the installer version and URL, the other file should be a MSI for the current language version which is the installer that is should be run. If it does not run automatically, you can double-click to manually run it.
  * Ultimately the libraries should get installed here: **C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Flamingo nXt\Libraries\en-US** and shortcuts should appear in the material library browser with is actually just a Windows file browser with a couple of shortcuts to **C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Flamingo nXt\Libraries\en-US\Materials** and **C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Flamingo nXt\Libraries\en-US\Plants.**

===Language Issues===
  * The flamingo library installers are downloaded to **C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Flamingo nXt\Libraries\Installers** in language specific folders. 
  * Flamingo is gets the language ID from Rhino and installs the corresponding materials package. 
  * The materials are extracted into language specific folders here: **C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Flamingo nXt\Libraries\Installers\en-us**. 
  * In the Library panel, you can navigate between language folders.
