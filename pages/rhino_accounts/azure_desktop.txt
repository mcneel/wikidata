===== Azure Virtual Desktop for Rhino =====

Azure Virtual Desktop should work with Rhino.
It works because Azure Virtual Desktop is Windows 10/11 (not Windows Server).

Windows Server is not a supported OS for Rhino 7.
(See Rhino System Requirement [[https://www.rhino3d.com/7/system-requirements/|here]].)

Most important issue to consider is performance, particularly graphics performance.
In the [[https://www.rhino3d.com/7/system-requirements/|Rhino 7 System Requirements]], a GPU and 4MB of VRAM is recommended.

Rhino really only works well with a GPU.
You may get it working on a computer with Azure, but if the graphics on the computer does not meet the min. recommended, Rhino's performance may not be acceptable to your Rhino users.

Set up a test computer using this configuration.
We can work with you to solve any licensing issues find during your test.
