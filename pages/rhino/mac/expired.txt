====== Why does Rhino say that it is expired? (Rhino 5 for Mac) ======
> **Summary:** //Rhino for Mac reports that it is expired for various reasons.//

=====Problem=====
A wide variety of problems can cause Rhino for Mac to report it has expired.

=====Answer=====
You have more than one copy of Rhino installed, and it is still starting the expired version. You must remove **all** copies of Rhino. 

Double click any 3DM file. If the file opens in Rhino, then you still have a copy of Rhino installed somewhere. 
  - Right-click the Rhino icon in the Dock, select **Options > Show in Finder** from the menu to find out where it is.
  - Drag that copy to the Trash. 
  - When no more copies of Rhino exist, double-clicking a 3DM file will open it with TextEdit instead. When this happens, all copies of Rhino have been removed.
  - Reinstall the version that you just downloaded.
