====== Mapped Images Not Found with “Interior Space” Tutorial ======

=====The Problem=====

The “Ar4 Tutorial” library is pathed to images in folders that do not exist.

The result of this is that some materials look default gray in the “Interior Start.dwg” or “Interior Finished.dwg”.

These drawings are used with the “Interior Space" tutorial that is in the AccuRender 4 “Getting Started” on page 24.

=====The Fix=====
To fix this problem, add the location where the files are stored to the AccuRender General Search Path.
