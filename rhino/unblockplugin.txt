====== Unblocking Rhino Plug-Ins ======

If you are having problems installing a plug-in, one reason may be because Windows has set a flag on the plug-in file which means "Windows doesn't know where this file came from". This typically happens for files downloaded from the internet or received throuh e-mail.

For security purposes, Windows will not load the plug-in into Rhino unless you take action by "unblocking" the file.
  * Close Rhino
  * Right click on the file and choose "Properties" from the context menu
  * You should see a dialog that looks like the image at the bottom of this page
  * Click on the "Unblock" button
  * Restart Rhino and attempt to load your plug-in
