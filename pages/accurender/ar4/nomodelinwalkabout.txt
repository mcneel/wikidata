====== No Model in the WalkAbout View ======
======Problem: No Model in the WalkAbout View======
> **Summary:** //AccuRender 3 and AccuRender 4//
This occurs when:

  * Loading the model by picking in the WalkAbout view (Ar3) or WalkAbout layout (Ar4).
  * Selecting the "Get [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] view now" command from the AccuRender menu, nothing appears in the WalkAbout view or layout.

=====Check the Model=====

First determine if the problem  is related to the model. Open one of the tutorial models that was included with AccuRender.

If the WalkAbout image appears for the tutorial model, it could be related to the working model.

If it only happens in one model, check to make sure the model is not far away from 0,0. Generally, far away is a model with base coordinates units above 10,000. If it is far away, move it back to 0,0 with the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] MOVE command.

Then load WalkAbout view. If you can not determine what is wrong with the model send it to McNeel Tech Support. Use the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] eTransmit command to pack up the model. See Tech Support below.

----
If there is still no image in the WalkAbout view, it is almost always related to video. Some clients had AR3 successfully loading the WalkAbout model, but AR4 did not load the WalkAbout on the same machine. The fix was to loaded new video drivers.

When choosing a new driver, please try to ensure that you use the newest [[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/whql/default.mspx|WHQL Certified]] drivers from your manufacturer's web site.

=====ADT and WalkAbout 4=====

Here the Model view needs to be taken off plan view, and then the WalkAbout Model loaded or reloaded.

Use one of the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] preset 3D views or [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 3DORBIT command to do this. Then reload the WalkAbout model.

=====Hardware Acceleration Conflict=====

After updating the driver or confirming that it is current, to go to ControlPanel/Display/Settings/Advanced/Troubleshooting and drag the slider labeled "Hardware Acceleration" all the way to the left. Then test to see if the problem has gone away. If the problem goes away, you know there is something in the Windows Display Driver that can't handle some of the [[rhino:opengl|OpenGL]] calls that AccuRender uses.

=====Safemode Test=====

Another diagnostic test is to restart your computer in Safe Mode and see if the crash still happens. (Restart the computer and hold the F8 key down as it restarts, then select "Safe Mode" from the white-on-black boot menu screen.) If you cannot repeat the crash in  Safe Mode, you can be almost certain that the [[rhino:opengl|OpenGL]] modes of your normal display driver are unable to handle what AccuRender is throwing at it.

=====Lower the Color Depth=====

If you have the best drivers you can find and the problem persists, try changing the color depth or resolution of the Display in ControlPanel/Display/Settings and see if the problem goes away.  The weakness in the driver may only be in some of the combinations of color depth and resolution.

=====Tech Support=====

If none of the above suggestions solve the issue, please email <tech@mcneel.com> with the specifics of your system. Please include:

  * version numbers on your display drivers
  * make and model of display card.
  * version of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] or ADT
  * Microsoft Operating System
When emailing, please include the results of all the suggestions above that you have tried.
