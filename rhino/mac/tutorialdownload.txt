=====Downloading the Mac Rhino Tutorial files on OS X 10.7 and later=====

If you select Help > Open Tutorial Files in the Rhino menu, and you do not have the tutorial files installed on your computer, you will be asked if you want to download them.  If you download the files, the file **rh40mac_wip_tutorials_20090112.dmg** will be downloaded to your Downloads folder.

Opening the **rh40mac_wip_tutorials_20090112.dmg** file will display a new Finder window containing the **RhinocerosTutorials.mpkg** file.

The **RhinocerosTutorials.mpkg** file was created by us before Apple created Gatekeeper, the utility that checks that downloaded files have been signed by a developer.  The **RhinocerosTutorials.mpkg** file is not signed.  If you double-click the **RhinocerosTutorials.mpkg** to run the tutorials installer, OS X will warn that the file was created by an unidentified developer and refuse to run it.

To work around this, right click (or control-click) the **RhinocerosTutorials.mpkg**, and select **Open** from the context menu.  This presents a different dialog that asks, "Are you sure you want to open it?".  Click the Open button and the tutorial installer will start.
