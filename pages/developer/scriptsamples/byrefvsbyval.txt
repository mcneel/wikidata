What exactly **ByRef** and **ByVal** means in VBScript has always been confusing. This is because VBScript uses //by reference// to mean two similar, but different things. VBScript supports

  - Reference types
  - Variable references

The best way to illustrate the difference is with an example.  Consider this class:

<code vb>
Class Foo 
  Public Bar 
End Class 
</code>

Now we can create an instance of this class: 

<code vb>
Dim Blah, Baz 
Set Blah = New Foo 
Set Baz = Blah 
Blah.Bar = 123 
</code>

Both Blah and Baz are references to the same object.  The fourth line changes both Blah.Bar and Baz.Bar because these are different names for the same thing.

That's the //reference type// feature.  We say that VBScript treats objects as reference types.

Now consider this little program: 

<code vb>
Sub Change(ByRef XYZ) 
  XYZ = 5 
End Sub 
Dim ABC 
ABC = 123
Change ABC 
</code>

This passes a reference to variable ABC.  The local variable XYZ becomes an alias for ABC, so the assignment XYZ = 5 changes ABC as well.
