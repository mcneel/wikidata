====== Using Rhino To Solve Math Equations ======

Although Rhino in a 3-D modeling application, you can also use it to solve mathematical equations. 
But Rhino does not have commands like "solve equation" or "plot graph". 
Therefore, you will need to use scripting.

Rhino 5 contains two scripting languages:\\
  * **Rhino.Python**
  * **RhinoScript**
Rhino 4 contains only **RhinoScript**. 

//Because of this, we would recommend using RhinoScript.//


For more information on **RhinoScript**, go [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/developer/rhinoscript|here.]]

===== Examples =====
To illustrate how you can use **RhinoScript** to solve mathematical problem, I have written two simple scripts that solve the first two questions of the math practice test.

Note, both of these solutions can be copied and pasted into the RhinoScript editor (EditScript) for testing.

==== 1. Graph the following equation: y = (x - 4)^2 = 2 ====
' Define range of x values
xrange = Array(-4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
' With each x value
For Each x In xrange
  ' Solve for y
  y = (x-4)^2 + 2
  ' Add a point at the x,y location
  Rhino.AddPoint Array(x, y)
Next

===== 2. With the following equation: f(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14, find zeros of function using these values: 2, 7, -2, -7 =====
' Define range of x values
xrange = Array(2, 7, -2, -7)
' With each x value
For Each x In xrange
  ' Solve for y, where y = f(x)
  y = (x^2) - (5*x) - 14
  ' If y is zero, print x
  If y = 0 Then Rhino.Print x
Next

The great thing about scripting is that it can be adapted to solve nearly any problem and in any manner chosen by the script writer.
