====== Scripting installation of Bongo 1.0 ======


Bongo 1.0 can be installed by a scripted installation.
To do that you can use the commands on the following page:
[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/flamingo/scriptinst_v3_fla11]]

The page is written for Flamingo and Rhino, but Bongo 1.0 uses the same 
commands.

The only command that's not mentioned on the page is the
/s.

It tells the installer to run silently (if you want that). This eliminates 
all dialog boxes.

For example, you can use the following line for a silent install:

C:\>bongo.exe /s /autoinstall /language="English" /key=XXXXYYYYZZZZ
