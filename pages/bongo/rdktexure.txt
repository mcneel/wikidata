======Animating RDK Texture======

In Bongo 2.0 you can animate texture properties on RDK Materials.

All you need to do is to press the Animate Button on the Timeline and open up the Texture in the material and start to make changes. Bongo adds animation data for every change you make.

Here are to example pictures, showing how you can animate for example the size of the squares in the checker texture.
