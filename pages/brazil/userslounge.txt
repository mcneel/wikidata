=====McLaren F1=====


A quick test for all the car people out there. Not quite HDRi but still pretty good. I used no lights, only Direct Illumination skylight and some bright panels. The F1 model was downloaded from http://www.accustudio.com

-John Cantu

Thanks John. A quick question. What material did you assign to the illuminated panel? TIA - Jeff

A Simple Bright Shader- John


Can you explain how HDRi works?

=====Brazil WIP 9=====


Here's a detail shot of the model from my advanced training CD (http://www.hydraulicdesign.net/advancedtraining.htm). I used the Depth of Field post effect and a tiny bit of Glare.

Looks great James. -John



Just playing around with glass on an old project. I used a gradient to vary the filter color, if you can tell.
