======Rhino License Validation: Online and Offline======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses Rhino license validation and how it works with the LAN Zoo//

Rhino 5, 6, and 7 use a license validation system to make it easier to recover lost or stolen license keys. License validation associates your license with your email address (or email domain in the case of a Lab License), a Rhino device name, Device ID, and for upgrade licenses, your previous license key. 

When you add a Rhino license to the Zoo, you are asked to validate the license online. Rhino licenses must be validated before they can be used.

=====Upgrading from previous versions=====
When you upgrade Rhino from a previous version, license validation associates the license from your previous version of Rhino with the license you are upgrading to. A previous version license can only be used to upgrade one Rhino license. For example, a company that owns four licenses of Rhino 4 wants to upgrade its licenses to Rhino 5. Each upgrade installation should be associated with a different Rhino 4 license for validation to succeed.

===== The validation process =====
When you add a valid Rhino license key to the LAN Zoo, the Rhino License Validation Wizard is displayed. Follow the instructions on the screen to validate your license.

If you get an error during license validation, please contact [[http://www.rhino3d.com/support|McNeel Technical Support]] for help. Please include the error description when you contact support.

===== Validating offline =====
If your Zoo server is //not// connected to the Internet, you can perform license validation offline. 
--**Note:** //Offline validation requires that Zoo server that will accept the offline validation code is truly offline with no internet or network access. Unplug the network cable and disconnect from the wireless for this option.
//
Here are the steps:
  - When you try to add a license to the Zoo that is offline, you will see this message{{:zoo:validate01.png?200|}}

  - Return to the Zoo server system.
  - In the Zoo console (run ZooAdmin) add your Rhino license key and click **OK**.
