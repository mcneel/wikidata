===== Frequently Asked Questions: Licensing in Rhino 6 =====

====What are my options for licensing Rhino 6?====
See https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/licensing-and-administration for details.

====Sharing Licenses====

===Can use one license of Rhino 6 on multiple computers?===
Yes, using either the Zoo or the Cloud Zoo.

===What if I want to install using single-computer licensing on multiple computers?===
You'll need a separate license key for each computer. Rhino 5 allowed more than one validation per single-user license key. Rhino 6 does not.

===How can I share one or more licenses with multiple people?===
Add your licenses to a team in the Cloud Zoo (recommended), or add your licenses to the Classic Zoo.

====Upgrading to Rhino 6 ====

===If I upgrade from Rhino 5 to Rhino 6, can I still use Rhino 5?===
When you upgrade, you are extending your license to give you access to Rhino 6 features - you are not adding a new license. This means that you can use Rhino 6 and older versions of Rhino on the same computer. You may not use Rhino 5 on one computer while someone else uses the Rhino 6 upgrade on another.

===If I put my Rhino 6 Upgrade license in the Cloud Zoo, can I still install Rhino 5?===
Yes, Rhino 5 can be installed on one computer, even if it has been upgraded to Rhino 6.

===Can I put my Rhino 5 license in the Cloud Zoo?===
No. Rhino 5 does not support the Cloud Zoo.

===If I put my Rhino 5 and Rhino 6 Upgrade Licenses in the Zoo, what happens?===
You'll need Zoo 6.1 to support Rhino 6 license keys. The Zoo will group your Rhino 5 and Rhino 6 Upgrade keys into one license, and will make sure only one is in use at any given time. A user who runs both Rhino 5 and Rhino 6 from the same computer will use only one license.
