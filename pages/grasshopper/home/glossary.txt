**A glossary of Grasshopper terms**

  * **Item**: A single datum (piece of data). Items can either contain a value, or they can be empty which Grasshopper will call //null//.
  * **List**: An ordered collection of data. Ordered meaning there's a first, second, third, ..., last item. Items inside lists are accessed by an //index//. 
  * **Index**: Indices are non-negative integers where 0 represents the first item, 1 the second item and so forth. Every item in a list is uniquely identified by a single index.
  * **Tree**: An ordered collection of lists. Lists are accessed by a //path//.
  * **Path**: An ordered collection of one or more non-negative integers. Usually written using curly braces and semi-colons as separators: `{0;7;0;2}` Just as you cannot have more than one item in a list with the same index, you also cannot have more than one list in a tree with the same path.
  * **Matrix**: 
  * **Sequence**: 
  * **Sets**: 
  * **Series**: 
  * **Range**: 
  * **Domain**: 
  * **Graft**: 
  * **Flatten**: 
  * **Simplify**:
