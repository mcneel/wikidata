**[[http://www.ibv.org|IBV - Instituto de Biomecánica de Valencia]]**

The mission of the Instituto de Biomecánica de Valencia (IBV) as a technological centre is to promote and undertake scientific research, technological development, technical advice and training in the area of Biomechanics.

Rhino is one of the key products used for research and commercial work at IBV. A result of the acquired experience in shoe design and manufacturing resulted in the advanced tutorial CD [[http://www.rhino3d.com/advanced.htm#footwear|Shoe Design and Visualization]] .

An example of a commercial sole and shoe was created by the IBV for the [[http://www.the-art-company.com|ART company]]. Rhino and Microscribe were used to digitize an existing last. Then the final last, sole and upper part were modeled in Rhino and Sensable and finally prototyped with a ZCorp color 3D printer.

**[[phil@optilevers.com|Phillip Carrizzi]]**

I am an artist from and currently working in Michigan. I've been using 2D software as a graphic designer and as a layout tool in my 3D work since I was an undergraduate metalsmithing major. I've been using Rhino casually since getting a copy of the demo in 2000, but finally got serious about it in 2003 when the school where I teach jewelry design (Kendall College of Art and Design) purchased the first of our CNC milling machines, and eventually an Envisitiontec Perfactory RP system, Stratasys Dimension 1200SST, and LaserPro Elite LASER engraving/cutting system. I teach classes in, among other things, CAD/CAM for Metals/Jewelry Design and Production Multiples. I am also the chair of the 2008 SIGGRAPH Studio.

A few of the schools that have CAD/CAM systems within their art departments, especially the crafts, are starting a new resource sharing consortium that is WIKI enabled. You must be a registered user to edit it - [[http://www.cadlaboration.com|www.cadlaboration.com]]

I also head the Virtual Reality/Digital Fabrication Lab at Kendall, which is also a wiki in progress - [[http://www.digfablab.com|www.digfablab.com]]

**Jack Meyer**


I've been working with Rhino since 2004, but I've been working with 3D modeling professionally since 1999. Before retraining in London as a jewellery designer and blacksmith, I worked for a military contractor designing models and environments for real-time flight simulators.

Rhino was my gateway into not only product design CAD, but also rapid prototyping as it applies to jewellery. This has now become the focus of my business. Since 2004, I have proceeded to gain certification in every other major CAD package currently used in the jewellery industry (as well as a few minor ones): 3Design CAD, Gemvision Matrix, ArtCAM Jewelsmith, [[rhino:claytools|Clay Tools]] (and Gemvision's version ClayTrix), and I'm currently working on certification in JewelCAD as well as DelCAM Designer. However, I still find myself coming back to Rhino time and time again thanks to its sheer flexibility and comparative ease of use.

Now, I offer CAD training in Rhino and several other CAD software packages through my company H3-D.

**Hello, my name is [[people:DavidRutten|David]] and I'm a Rhinoholic...**


I was about to give up on CG altogether when I discovered Rhino 1.0 during my first year at uni. I've used it extensively for architectural and urban projects and eventually discovered my true calling through [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]]. Since then I've written a handout about RhinoScript, gave a lecture in London, hosted a workshop in Vienna, and written hundreds of scripts for the public domain. Part of my site is dedicated to Rhino, scripting, and programming:

**Sam Page, recovering from a bad AutoCAD addiction with the help of Rhino**


I'm a set designer for [[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1113080/|feature films]] working in the Los Angeles area. We use Rhino heavily for quickly generating models to fly the director and production designer through. Where Rhino becomes indispensable (like it isn't already) is when, as often is the case, we are doing something very free form and organic. Rhino not only allows us to model such complex forms, but also to section our models every which way to generate useful information for our construction departments.

**[[rhino@publicsculpture.com|Heath Satow]]  Just when I had given up on 3D ...**


I am a metal sculptor in the Los Angeles area and had been using 2D CAD products for years, but still had to build elaborate physical models to present my ideas to clients.  I tried demos of just about every available 3D CAD product out there and decided that I would need to work in CAD full-time to become proficient enough to justify the use of the software.  Then someone showed me Rhino, and I was hooked the first day... Here was a package I could really use for my work, without having to be a full-time CAD guy.  It's revolutionized the way I create sculpture, and has kept me highly competitive in tough field. Almost all my work these days is designed and presented using Rhino, and you can see this work at [[http://www.publicsculpture.com|PublicSculpture.com]].

Rhino entered my life as an early prerelease version in 1996 after I read an article about "[[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] for Windows" in what became 3D World. From that point on I was addicted and have used Rhino as my number 1 modeling program since. I use Rhino somewhere in all my design work, both for graphics and 3D production or visualization. I have been teaching Rhino in Norway for many years and have been a certified teacher for over two years. [[http://www.holografisk.no|www.holografisk.no]] (So far only in Norwegian)

Probably most noted for my work with Flamingo, much of which has probably been down to luck rather than judgment.  Still, it has seen me through three years of business for very little financial outlay and I can get it to do pretty much what I want.  Hoping to try and get as much as I can down in writing in the Flamingo section of the wiki.  Generally very excited by the development of V4 and Brazil R/S as a rendering plug-in - exciting times for Rhinophiles everywhere I think!!

**[[phill@masterwerkes.com| Phill Pittman ]]    -  Carving with Rhino**


My lifelong business of architectural carving and heroic scale sculpture took a whole new turn when I discovered Rhino. Soon after, I turned my very traditional carving studio into full time CNC carving, CAD development and production.  From concept to rendering, I primarily design (and present) from within Rhino.  I also keep quite busy in a product development and prototype arm of my business. Full scale auto body panels, small craft, statues, and surfboards keep life interesting. Contract architectural ornament design fufills my creative needs when I am not working on my full scale 3-D //Last Supper//. Hopefully I will get it finished (with the help of Rhino) before I kick off. I would have never gotten past first base without the newsgroup, a sincere thanks to all!

**[[jack@jhkunnen.name|Jack Kunnen]] A Rhino-mold-design-phile...**


I started using Rhino with version 1 Beta just to read in IGES files that Cadkey and Microstation won't.  Now I'm doing all the 3D work for my mold and die cast die designs.  I've found Rhino to be faster and more accurate than any of the CAD systems I've been trained on.  I do like the feature trees of solid modelers, but these modelers still can't handle the surfaces on the parts I get to work with, only [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] will to the trick.  Can't wait for the release of version 4.

**[[gcwebster36@gmail.com|G.C. Webster]] (Guilherme C. Webster)**


Born 1983 and located in the south of Brazil, I'm an addicted Rhino user always looking for improvements. I started to work with it when the software was on the version 2.0.

For almost three years I worked developing 3D projects for brands such as adidas, Diadora, Clarks, and others. December 2004 I decided to learn VB / [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] (using David's [[http://www2.rhino3d.com/resources/display.asp?language=en&listing=601|handout]]) to develop my own scripts. Since March 2006 I've dedicating myself mostly to my industrial design graduation studies, but Rhino still plays an important part in my life. Nowadays I can humbly consider myself an advanced user - but I'll never quit learning some more...

**[[osuire@gmail.com|Olivier Suire]] Lightweight Rhino...**


I am a designer in the field of tensile structures. I just can't do my job without Rhino. From the first pilot study to really tricky workshop drawing problems, Rhino rules. I use it in conjunction with SolidWorks, and they both communicate quite well. The Gelfling did a pretty amazing job in making my (work) life even better with a few of his magic scripts, but using his great scripting handout, I'm starting to do my own!

**[[ich@vikingeskibsmuseet.dk|Ivan Conrad Hansen]] 3D documentation of ancient wrecks. For doing that a combination of Rhino and Faro Arm is unique.**


I have been using Rhino through the last five years. I'm using it together with a Faro Arm. I document ship timbers from the Viking age, bits and pieces from Stone age, and much more. We have to save our cultural inheritance, and here Rhino is very useful. A 3D recording saved in more than 35 different layers, on a platform we distribute to other countries. The idea is to make it easier to read drawings, made in different parts of Europe, and a result of that, is an easier way to analyse all the different wrecks, found in the mud. http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk

**[[ted@ted-kyte.com|Ted Kyte]]**

I don't suffer from Rhino phobia, I enjoy it.

Located in Southern Alberta Canada, I design rodeo and livestock equipment around the world. I have used AutoCAD for 20 years and tried numerous other CAD packages. I heard about Rhino and downloaded the Version 3 demo and was simply amazed at its ease of use and the UI. I bought it the next day. I am normally a hard sell. I beat stuff up for a long time before I buy it and even then very seldom do.

I currently do a lot of 3D modeling with Rhino, some for my work, but mostly just for freelance, enjoyment, and for my web page.

I like the product so much that I have recently become a reseller and look forward to meeting and dealing with more Rhinophiles.

Another thing that stands out with the McNeel line of products is the support. They go way beyond the call of duty to keep customers happy.

I can't go a day without doing something with Rhino, hence the phobia... :)

I started with Rhino in my happy and worry-free student years, and I'm still trying to quit.

The worst thing is that I got my younger brother hooked too, and now we are both using Rhino in our daily life.

-Yes even at work!
We use it for modeling products and rapid prototyping.
