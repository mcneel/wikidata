======Setup and Planning for Cloud Zoo Licensing======

Cloud Zoo Licensing is the newest way to license Rhino 6. See an overview of [[rhino:6:license|Rhino 6 Licensing]].

=====Cloud Zoo personal licenses setup=====

  - [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/help#create_account|Create a Rhino account]]
  - [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/help#licenses|Add a license to your Cloud Zoo]]
  - Login to Rhino when it starts


=====Cloud Zoo teams for offices and schools=====
The Cloud Zoo supports the creation of teams. Teams are groups of people that can use a set of licenses in the Zoo.

**Cloud Zoo teams setup**

  - [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/help#create_account|Create a Rhino account]]
  - [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/help#create_group|Create a team in your Cloud Zoo]]
  - [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/help#licenses|Add licenses to your team]]
  - Invite members to your team using one of two methods:
      - [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/help#invite_group_members|Invite individual members]]
      - [[https://accounts.rhino3d.com/help#link_domain|Associate the organization's domain with a team]]

===Team member use===

  - Prospective Team member must have their own Rhino login account
  - Team members accept invitation sent to their login account email address
  - Team members can use Rhino by using Login at Rhino Startup


**Domain linked teams**

For easier administration of larger teams, accounts linked through a domain can be set up. Anybody with an email address matching that domain can automatically join your domain linked team and have access to your licenses -- no invitation email verification is required. Domain linked teams support custom authentication providers (Google, Active Directory, or One Login) to keep your user management centralized. Link your team to a domain.
