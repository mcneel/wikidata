====== Python Scripting in Mac Rhino ======
Starting with the 2010-03-08 WIP release of Mac Rhino, there is support for a new test plug-in which adds Python scripting to Rhino. There are a few things that you must do in order to add this support beyond installing the Wenatchee WIP.

  - [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/wenatchee/5.0/wip|Install the latest OSX Rhino release]]
  - Run this new version of Rhino.  This will register the .macrhi extension with the Rhino application.  You only need to do this once.  Now double-clicking any .macrhi file will launch Rhino.
  - [[http://community.irhino3d.com/content/DownloadIronPython.aspx|Download the IronPython .macrhi plug-in installer]] - This is a Mac Rhino plug-in installer for Python.  Double-click the file to install the plug-in in Rhino.  Mac Rhino will start and install the plug-in.
  - Shut down and restart Rhino. You should now have a new command available called "RunPythonScript"

====RunPythonScript====
There are two versions of this command:

**RunPythonScript** - will display a file open dialog that lets you pick a python script (.py file.) The plug-in includes a set of sample scripts that you can run and the dialog should point you to this directory the first time you run it.

**-RunPythonScript** - The "dashed" version of this command lets you type in a script file name. If the script exists in the Scripts directory on your computer it will be executed. You can use the period to run a script in a subdirectory of the Scripts directory. For example, if you wanted to run the CurveLength.py file in the samples subdirectory you could type samples.curvelength at the prompt.

//NOTE//: All of the samples included in this plug-in should work on both [[http://mac.rhino3d.com|Mac Rhino WIP]] and the [[http://www.rhino3d.com/|Windows Rhino 5]]!

Steve Baer is working on RhinoCommon and Python for both Windows and Mac Rhino.  He hangs out in the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/category/scripting/|scripting forum]] and you should post your Python questions there.
