> **Summary:** //Discusses light attenuation in Rhino.//

=====Question=====
I am interested in taking advantage **ON_Light::Attenuation** in my render plug-in, and I need to clarify how I can use it. Is the input vector supposed to represent the distance over which I want the light to attenuate to zero? I have a feeling I'm not understanding the intent.

=====Answer=====
Light attenuation determines how fast the light intensity decreases with distance from objects.

The three coefficients to light attenuation are:

  - Constant attenuation (**C**)
  - Linear attenuation (**L**)
  - Quadratic attenuation (**Q**)

Thus, you could create the input vector as follows:

<code c++>
ON_3dVector attenuation( C, L, Q );

</code>
=====More Information=====

  * If you want constant attenuation, or (1 / C), then both L and Q must be 0 and C > 0 (usually = 1.0).
  * If you want linear attenuation, or (1 / (C + d*L)) where d = distance to light, then C and L vary and Q must be 0.
  * If you want quadratic attenuation, or (1 / (C + d**L + d^2**Q)), then all 3 coefficients can and should vary.

Note, Rhino's user interface only uses constant attenuation so that adding a light reveals everything, no matter how far away the light source is from any given piece of geometry.
