====== MaqueTools toolbar ======

I have compiled a collection of RhinoScripts I have created over the last few years into a workspace - in the form of a master toolbar with flyouts.  I chose this form as it is easily portable and installable in any Rhino.  The tools in the V4 collection should all work in both Rhino V4 and V5.  They will most likely not run in earlier versions.  There may be some that appear in the V5 collection that will not run in V4, as Rhinoscript has been extended for V5, and I am slowly adding Python scripts (which don't run in V4). 

I use many of these tools every day, those have been more or less thoroughly tested, but there still may be bugs in some of them. [[rhinoceros@swissrhino.com|If you find a bug or failure, please report it to me]] (preferably with an example file) so I can fix it.  I try to make this stuff as reliable, user-friendly and bulletproof as possible, but there are no absolute guarantees - use at your own risk.

===== What's in the collection? =====

{{people:maquetools_explanations_v108.pdf|Here is a PDF file with a short description of the current toolset (v1.08, 06.09.2012)}}

[[http://www.swissrhino.com/RhinoToolbars/Maquetools.zip|Download the V4/V5 toolbars plus the PDF in a Zip file here]]

===== How do I install the tools?=====
The toolset is offered both as a V4 .tb toolbar file as well as a V5 .rui file.  These may be imported into V4 or V5 in the usual fashion [[rhino:toolbarimports |(see here if you don't know how)]].  Once open, you may copy the topmost button (MaqueTools) into your normal workspace.  You may then close the MaqueTools main toolbar (if you don't want it open all the time) and use the copied button to recall it when needed.  In V5, you can also dock the main toolbar as a tab if you are using the tabbed workspace.  Alternatively, you may copy individual buttons or toolbars to your own workspace as desired, or even edit the buttons and pull out the scripts behind.  If you are copying scripts to modify/pass on, please credit the original author (me).

===== Why aren't there image icons for all the buttons? =====
I don't have the time to design/implement button images for all, but if anyone is interested, I will be happy to accept contributions of images for the next version.  LOL
