===== Running V5 Mac Rhino in 32-bit mode =====

<color red>Update:</color> Mac Rhino now runs only as a 64-bit application on Intel hardware. It is no longer possible to run Mac Rhino in 32-bit mode.  Previously you needed to run Mac Rhino in 32-bit mode if you wanted to run Python scripts.  That is no longer necessary, as Python is now supported in 64 bit mode.

<del>Mac Rhino in version 5 includes three different processor architectures.  At start time, OS X picks the appropriate version of the program to run.  If you have a PowerPC processor, OS X will pick the 32-bit PowerPC version of Mac Rhino.  If you have an Intel Core 2 Duo processor or later, OS X will run the 64-bit Intel version of Mac Rhino.  If you have a Core Duo Intel processor, you will be running the 32-bit version of Mac Rhino.</del>

The Rhino > About Rhino box will show you which version you are running:

<del>In some situations, you may wish to start Rhino in 32-bit Intel mode rather than 64-bit mode.  To do so, select the Rhinoceros 5 program in the Applications folder in the Finder and select File > Get Info in the Finder's menu.  A dialog like the following will display:</del>

<del>Quit Rhino if it is running.

Check the box that says "Open in 32-bit mode"

Close the dialog and start Rhino.  It will now be running as a 32-bit application.

The About Rhino dialog will now look like this:</del>

<del>You can switch Rhino back to a 64-bit mode by clearing the "Open in 32-bit mode" check box.</del>
