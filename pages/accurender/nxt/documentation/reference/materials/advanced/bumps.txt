====== The Bumps Tab ======
The Bumps tab provides options for creating the appearance of a specific kind of surface without using displacement maps or requiring the user to provide any additional maps. The patterns offered are: Sandpaper, Rubble, Wrinkled, Marbled, and Pyramid. When one of the bump maps is checked, additional controls become available. Strength controls the appearance of depth. Scale controls the proportional size of the bumps.
