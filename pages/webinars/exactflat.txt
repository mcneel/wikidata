Join Mark Jewel and Luke Niwranski of ExactFlat for an overview of digital patterning and the ExactFlat plugin for Rhino for Windows.  They will show how ExactFlat works to flatten a number of products like a backpack, fire bowl, and other examples. 

This webinar is for anyone designing in 3-D and needing to “flatten” the model into an accurate 2-D cut design.  This is especially serious in  the automotive, furniture, accessories and marine industries. 

Questions/answer forum will follow presentation.
Presentation will be recorded and posted here on July 28:
