====== The Rhino Installer Engine ======

The Rhino Installer Engine simplifies distribution, installation, and updating of plug-ins for Rhino 4.0 and 5.0 on both 32- and 64- bit platforms.

=====How it works=====
A Rhino Installer Package is a zip file with an .RHI extension. The RHI file can contain directory structures, and can include more than one version of a plug-in. 

There are no file structure or naming requirements.

For example:
<code>
  myPlugIn\4.0\myPlugIn.rhp
  myPlugIn\5.0\x86\myPlugIn.rhp
  myPlugIn\5.0\x64\myPlugIn.rhp
</code>
works just as well as
<code>
  myPlugIn_rhino4.rhp
  myPlugIn_rhino5_x86.rhp
  myPlugIn_rhino5_x64.rhp
</code>

The Rhino Installer Engine examines each plug-in and extracts the plug-in GUID, Title, Version, and appropriate SDK version numbers. It also examines each Rhino installed on the computer.

The Rhino Installer Engine supports installing AnyCPU plug-ins written in .NET and will register them with both 32- and 64-bit Rhino 5.

Next, each plug-in is compared to each installed version of Rhino. The newest compatible plug-in is registered with the corresponding version of Rhino.

=====Limitations=====
  * The Rhino Installer Engine will copy files from the RHI archive, and will register the plug-ins it finds. No other execution is done.
  * Currently, it is not possible to digitally sign RHI files. This means it is also not possible to verify the source of RHI files.
  * The Rhino Installer Engine is currently **available with Rhino 5.0**. It will install plug-ins for Rhino 4.0, but there isn't a separate redistributable for the Rhino Installer Engine for Rhino 4.0.
