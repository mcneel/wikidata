{{:rhino:mac:consolemessages.png|}}

You now have a number of log messages about Rhino.  There are likely a number of messages all with almost the exact same date and time.  Select at least these messages, and maybe even more.  To do this, click the bottom message (the latest one), then scroll to the earliest message you want to send to McNeel.  Shift click this message to select all the messages in between.  Press Command-C to copy the messages.

Start a new email message, paste the messages into the body of the email and send them to mactech@mcneel.com.  Include an explanation why you are sending us these console messages.

Quit Console.
