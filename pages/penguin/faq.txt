====I get an error loading Penguin Service Release 3.====


After successfully installing Penguin Service Release 3, I open Rhino and Penguin will not load. This error appears: **Unable to load plug-in: ID not found in registered plug-in list.**

This can happen on all versions of Windows: XP, Vista, Windows 7, both 32-bit and 64-bit.  To fix this issue:  
  *Install the [[http://download.rhino3d.com/rhino/4.0/sr|latest Rhino 4 service release]].
  *Download and install:  [[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=766a6af7-ec73-40ff-b072-9112bab119c2|Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package ATL Security Update]].

====My Penguin rendering stops at 0 percent. How can I fix this?====
This appears to happen with users who have low admin rights on their PC. To fix this:
  * Open Rhino.
  * Immediately start the PenguinSettings command before you launch a first render.
  * Pick a style.

  * After selecting any style or making your own, you should be able to render with [[penguin:home|Penguin]] successfully.
