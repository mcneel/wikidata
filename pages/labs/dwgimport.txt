** Rhino 4.0 Plug-in to import dwg & DXF files **

=====Description=====

This plug-in for Rhino 4.0 fixes a bug in DWG/DXF import in Rhino SR4.

You only need this if you have an early release candidate for SR4 and are having trouble reading ACAD files with splined plines.  This is temporary until SR4 is updated to include this fix.

First rename or move the original then then place the//import_ACAD.rhp// file from this [[http://Download.mcneel.com/Import_ACAD/Import_ACAD.zip|zip archive]] in your Rhino 4.0 installation plug-ins directory.
