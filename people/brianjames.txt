=====Rhino Materials=====

This basic .RMTL library is already installed with v5 Rhino and can be found in the 'Libraries' panel. Associated texture maps and environment files (.RENV) are included. This sample image is of the metal materials and was made using the Neon viewport display plugin available here... http://v5.rhino3d.com/group/neon.
