====== WalkAbout ======

The WalkAbout interface provides a variety of services encapsulated into a single nXt utility.  Its basic functions include:

  * An alternative to AutoCAD viewing and navigation commands, including an intuitive walk-through mode.
  * Fixed aspect ratio viewports so that exact views can be replicated consistently, even across different machines. 
  * An interactive image background interface for placing models into photographs.

Some advanced features can only be accessed through the WalkAbout interface.  These include:

  * Additional projections not found in AutoCAD, such as two-point perspectives and panoramas.
  * A batch processor which allows you to calculate and save multiple renderings in a single session.
  * 3D Slide Show-- an easy to use yet sophisticated animation engine.
  * A sun study animation engine.
  * The ability to render a rectangular region of your view.
