> **Summary:** //How to add a custom popup menu to Rhino's main menu from a Rhino plug-in.//

===== C++ =====

The **CRhinoPlugIn** class provides a number of methods that make adding custom popup menus to Rhino easy.

  * CRhinoPlugIn::InsertPlugInMenuToRhinoMenu - inserts a menu into Rhino's main menu.
  * CRhinoPlugIn::RemovePlugInMenuFromRhino - removes a menu from Rhino's main menu.
  * CRhinoPlugIn::OnInitPlugInMenuPopups - called when your menu is about to be displayed.
  * CRhinoPlugIn::OnPlugInMenuCommand - called when one of your menu items is selected.

See rhinoSdkPlugIn.h for details on the **CRhinoPlugIn** class.

=====.NET SDK=====
Creating and handling menus in .NET is slightly different than the C++ SDK. The .NET solution is to create an instance of a RMA.UI.MRhinoPlugInMenu class, populate it with strings and use event handlers to handle when the menu items are clicked or need updating.
