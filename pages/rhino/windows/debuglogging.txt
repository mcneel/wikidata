====== Enable Debug Logging in Rhino for Windows ======

//If you're reading this then you've probably been sent here by one of our support technicians or developers!//

To enable debug logging in Rhino for Windows, please run the ''_TestEnableDebugLogging'' command. Set //Enable=True// and //SaveTo=File//.

Now restart Rhino and try to reproduce the behaviour that you've reported to us. Once you're able to do so, locate the file “RhinoDebugMessages.txt” in your My Documents folder and send it to us!



In the event that Rhino crashes on startup or fails to license itself, you can enable debug logging by editing the [[https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-registry-editor-2625150|Windows Registry]].

  * Under ''HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\8.0\Global Options\Debug Logging''
    * Create REG_DWORD (32) value named “Enabled” and set the data to “1”
    * Create REG_DWORD (32) value named “SaveToFile” and set the data to “1”

Again, restart Rhino and try to reproduce the behaviour that you've reported to us. Once you're able to do so, locate the file “RhinoDebugMessages.txt” in your My Documents folder and send it to us!
