COMING SOON

  - [[http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/beginning_a_xamarin_trial|Start a Xamarin Trial]].  The Xamarin Starter edition allows you to unlock a 30-day trial of the full Business Edition, which will be necessary for using RhinoMobile.  You will need to create a Xamarin Login.  If you are unable to start a trial after creating a login, don't worry, Xamarin Studio will prompt you to when you try to build RhinoMobile projects.
