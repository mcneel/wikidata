Manuel Hidalgo lleva más de 50 años entregado a la geometría descriptiva, y se ha dedicado a la docencia en la Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Con más de 20 años de experiencia en CAD y usuario de [[rhino:rhinoceros|RhinoCeros]] desde las primeras versiones, Manuel pone a disposición de los usuarios de Rhino todo el material utilizado en sus clases a estudiantes de Arquitectura. Tanto él como sus alumnos han encontrado en Rhino la herramienta ideal para calcular y representar cualquier forma imaginable con precisión absoluta.

Manuel Hidalgo has more than 50 years experience in descriptive geometry and has been teaching in the Universad Politcnica de Madrid. With more than 20 years' experience in CAD, he has chosen Rhino as the right tool for him and his students to represent any given form with total accuracy. Manuel Hidalgo wants to share with us his extensive manuals, a collection of theory and exercises he has been using in his classes to architectural students:

As an Artist I do a lot of unfoldings to realize my work.

Later I cut them with Laser (Bystronic-machines) and shape it on a rounding machine.

I work with IronCad and Rhino.

I do my unfoldings with Rhino.

In architectural free-form design, the relationship between shape and fabrication poses new challenges and requires more sophistication from the underlying geometry. The new concept of conical meshes satisfies central requirements for this application: They are quadrilateral meshes with planar faces and are therefore particularly suited to the design of free-form glass structures.

Technical design of roof and faade structures for [[rhino:architecture|Architecture]] has accelerated in the last three decades with successive emphasis on free-form stretched membrane structures, systemized metal space structures, sophisticated tensegrity structures, glass envelope constructions, and load-bearing glass structures. This type of [[rhino:architecture|Architecture]] is computer-based rather than culture-based. Hence it cannot be regarded as a new style of architecture, as it does not have its roots in philosophy and human behavior. In a sense, it is caused by technology-driven interest of architects, who have learned the newest generation of 3-D design computer programs, capable of designing complicated virtual 3-D buildings that seem to be real.

Our team designs reliable, efficient, and sophisticated structures in cooperation with clients, architects, and contractors.

Creativity and design competence provide the background of our work and lead to innovative solutions.

Rhino is used in our office generally in two ways. For projects like [[http://www.khing.de/projekte_dacher.php?id=24|FH4]] or [[http://www.khing.de/projekte_dacher.php?id=47|Admirant Eindhoven]] we developed the triangular mesh. Modelling the entire building in projects like [[http://www.khing.de/projekte_brucken.php?id=46|Probst Bridge Stuttgart]] enables us, for example, to generate drawings for the concrete formwork via CAD-software directly from the 3-D model.

Here are various [[rhino:architecture|Architecture]] works up to 2004. Everything is modeled in Rhino.

In general in [[rhino:architecture|Architecture]] works, I use Rhino for large models with terrain, etc.

I hope you find this of some interest.

**[[http://www.greiner-engineering.com/|Greiner Engineering]]**

----
We now use Rhino in almost all of our projects:

  * for geometrical design
  * for establishing manufacturing data; for example, for laser patterns
  * for specification data in the finite element area
  * for object demonstration (presentations)

Universal Joint Design Associates (UJDA) is an Austin-based design-build firm focused upon the bridging of [[rhino:architecture|Architecture]] and Engineering. In many ways we think [[rhino:architecture|Architecture]] falls somewhere between sculpture and machine design.

UJDAs bLOG focuses upon the organization and rationalization of so-called free-form structures.

Current research revolves around a Classical Mathematical Model Collection originally made by hand in plaster in the 1860s.
