----
PRESENTATION 1 - **McNeel U.S.** (Developers of Rhino)

Scott Davidson & Carlos Perez

Quick review of the upcoming Rhino 4 release focusing on these new new features:

  * "Improved modeling tools, including better variable-radius blend tools and improved Booleans.
  * "New editing tools, including direct polysurface (solids) editing tools and command history.
  * "Interface enhancements, including new SmartTrack™ technology and more advanced display options.
  * "Improved 2-D drawing tools, including line types, line weights, hidden lines, hatching, dimensions, leaders, page layouts, and printing/plotting.
  * "Better mesh support. All editing tools should work on mesh objects as well as on [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] objects.
  * "More robust third-party software developer tools development - RhinoArq and NPR rendering demonstrations show the direction some of this development is taking.

Also includes upcoming development projects that McNeel are working on.

PRESENTATION 2 - **Simply Rhino Limited** (Rhino Support, Training & Sales)

Phil Cook

Advanced Training for Rhino v4.0. This is an excerpt from the new advanced training material.

Creating an accurate model of a shelled moulded component can sometimes be less than straightforward - sharp external radii won't offset inwards correctly and things get worse when your client requests last minute changes. Phil Cook from Simply Rhino outlines a typical workflow for this situation and shows how some new v4 tools/improvements can save time.

Create Solid (manifold solid)

Variable Fillet/Blend

Trim

Rib/Bosses

Match Srf

Remove Edge

Extend Trimmed Srf

PRESENTATION 3 - **McNeel U.S.** (Developers of Rhino)

Andy Le Bihan

Next generation rendering in Rhino with news on Brazil, the (under development) high quality renderer from McNeel.

PRESENTATION 4 - **John Marshall  - rootoftwo**


John Marshall is undertaking research at The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen into the notion that digital tools such as Rhinoceros® enable new sets of creative, cultural and economic conditions for artists, architects, and designers.  Since 2002, Marshall has been working with sculptor Malcolm Cochran using Rhinoceros® as a design and visualisation tool for large scale public art projects.  This presentation will look at the contribution made by Rhinoceros® in the development of several works.


Marshall co-founded the company ‘rootoftwo’ in 1998 to research, develop, produce, and exhibit contemporary artworks, which incorporate emerging art forms and technology.  Previously, Marshall has worked as an Associate Lecturer in 3D Design at Leeds College of Art & Design and as a Designer/Model Maker for Evenflo Company, Inc.

John presented at the UK Rhino User Group in 2005 and will be giving us all an update on his work.

PRESENTATION 7 **McNeel U.S.** (Developers of Rhino)

Rajaa Issa

Introducing two Rhino 4 architectural plugins.

SolidTools plugin to directly manipulate extruded geometry through stretching faces, moving edges, creating and editing holes and Boolean extrusions.  The plugin has enhanced surface and curve editing tools such as soft editing, partial untriming and extending trimmed surfaces.

[[labs:archcut|ArchCut]] plugin provides tools for sectioning architectural models and generating paneling grids. Sectioning include tools to import section locations, create, update, 2D layout and report.  Paneling tools support a variety of paneling algorithms ranging from well-defined paneling directions to completely random paneling.


----
PRESENTATION 8 **Versarout**

Norman Amos

Versarout will be demonstrating how they have paired Rhino & [[rhino:rhinocam|RhinoCAM]] to drive their CNC Woodworking Machines.  They have also recently added RhinoART and will be showing how this new Rhino plug-in is used to convert artwork into geometry suitable for machining.

PRESENTATION 9 **ASGVIS** (Developers of V-Ray for Rhino)

Damien Alomar

V-Ray for Rhino Presentation
