====== With the latest advances today in graphics processors (GPU), there are many really nice features and effects that can be achieved in real-time (RT) inside Rhino's viewport. However, in the past, Rhino has always been made to run on any PC computer configuration, and in order to do that, several limitations needed to be imposed on what Rhino should or shouldn't do, or more precisely, what Rhino could or could not do. That's all about to change with the next version of Rhino. The next version of Rhino will support real-time shadows and material shaders. Rhino will also support many of the GPU-based memory management features such as Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO) and Frame Buffer Objects (FBO) in order to achieve certain effects as well as boost performance in many areas. That being said, it is clear that with these additions to Rhino will no longer run on just any PC computer configuration, and will require specific hardware as well as specific driver/software support. This page is dedicated to '''tracking''' which cards McNeel is currently testing and using.  This page is '''NOT''' designed for, or setup to, recommending one graphics card over another, it merely shows which cards work with the latest features and whether their performance is acceptable in certain situations (ie. Things might work, but are very slow). ======
