BONGO

> **Question:** ////
I've been using Rhino for years and recently downloaded a bongo evaluasion. Any ideas how bongo measures up to 3d studio max or maya for that matter?

Ho Donavan - I would recommend posting questions like this to the rhino newsgroup (there is a link on http://www.rhino3d.com)

=====Cinema4D=====
I use dxf export from Rhino to C4D and it works great. 2004 Natural, with a tweek or two and its perfect. Preserves Layers and Colors.

ps It was a pain doing it over and over to determine which version and settings to use. [Larry - 2005-11-29]

Free renderer.

A discussion in forums is about supporting 3DM format for import: [http://www.kerkythea.net/joomla/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=76]

Seems like a lot of members deals with [[rhino:architecture|Architecture]].

For now, exporting to .3DS seems the best way to deal with it.

=====Maxwell Render, the light simulator=====

You can find several videos here http://www.maxwellrender.com/plugins/rhino/index.php with workflow examples for Rhino 4 and Maxwell Render.


=====Max=====

> **Question:** //Does anybody know what the best way is to work with 3dm files in **3ds Max 7.0**. What would be the best exchange file or translation file. We have a client who works with Rhino and we work with 3dsMax 7.0. We tried to import the 3ds file our client produced but it didn't work. The only file that could be imported was the .[[accurender:ar4:dwg|dwg]] file exported out of Rhino.If anybody knows a better solution, please let me know.//

> **Answer:** //Use nPower RhinoToMax. This is a max plugin, and allows max to read rhino files directly. [MALaFon 2005-11-22]//

> **Answer2:** //Have you tryed the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] [[accurender:ar4:dwg|dwg]] format, its very well imported in max. You can have the layer structure and also you can use 3D curve as Pipe! [SkySurfer 2007-07-18]//

> **Answer:** //Ive found the OBJ format to be the best way to carry rhino files into max//

=====Maxwell Render=====
> **Question:** //How to export from Rhino to Maxwell Renderer best? Thanks in advance! [Sosna 2006-11-28]//
