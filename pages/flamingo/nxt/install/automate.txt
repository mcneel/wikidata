====== Automating installation of Flamingo nXt ======


The Flamingo installer can be automated by System Administrators who want to deploy Rhino 5 throughout an organization.

These techniques will work for automated installation by running the MSI from a folder that contains a customized FlamingoSetup.ini.

The downloaded FlamingonXt installer is a 7-zip archive that can be extracted into its original folder structure. Within the Installers folder will be an example FlamingoSetup.ini which can be modified for an automated install.

Specifics for modifying the ini file are found on the [[rhino:installingrhino:5.0|Rhino installer instructions]].
