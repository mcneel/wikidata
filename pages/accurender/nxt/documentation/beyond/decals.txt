====== Decals ======

Decals are non-tiling image maps which you apply directly to objects (instead of indirectly via the object's material.)  Decals can be used to represent a variety of visual phenomena, including a painting hung on the wall, labels on jars, printed signs, etc.

**Use the following steps to apply a decal to an object:**

  - Expand the Object Properties tab on the nXt Palette
  - Select the object
  - Right-click on the Decals list and select **New**
  - Select either **Planar** or **Cylindrical Decal** 
  - Follow the prompts at the command line (make sure to accept the decal by pressing **Enter** when finished)

The decal will appear in the list any time the object is selected.

**To remove a decal from an object:**

  - Expand the Object Properties tab on the nXt Palette
  - Select the object
  - Right-click on the decal you wish to remove
  - Select **Remove**

 
The decal will no longer appear in the list when the object is selected.

**To reposition an existing decal:**

  - Expand the Object Properties tab on the nXt Palette
  - Select the object
  - Right-click on the decal you wish to reposition
  - Select **Edit Position and Orientation**
  - Follow the prompts to reposition (make sure to accept the decal by pressing **Enter** when finished)

**To change the surface properties of a decal:**

  - Expand the Object Properties tab on the nXt Palette
  - Select the object
  - Right-click on the decal you wish to edit  
  - Select **Properties...**

The Decal Properties dialog box will appear, letting you change many of the surface properties of your decal.
