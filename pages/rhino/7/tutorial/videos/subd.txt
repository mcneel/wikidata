====== Rhino 7 SubD Tutorials ======

> **Summary:** Rhino 7 includes a new Sub-D Geometry Type to allow for more flexible modeling.  Rhino's SubD are accurate and repeatable.  This allows our SubD to be converted to NURBS for fabrication.

=====Modeling a Coin Frame in the Rhino 7 SubD=====

| [[https://youtu.be/IB8ET_pI5_k|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:subd-trav-coin.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | Learn how to use the new QuadRemesh command and SubD tools in Rhino3D to model a jewelry coin frame. SubD modeling is one Rhino's new capabilities. You can quickly sculpt and edit soft transitions. (5 minutes)|=====SubD Fun in Rhino 7 WIP!=====

| [[https://youtu.be/SWKk2KBsdb4|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:subd-giuseppe-dog.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | In this quick video, Giuseppe Massoni shows us how you can swiftly turn a SubD sphere into a dog. He uses simple push and pull techniques on subdivision faces and control net points, using the Gumball. You'll note the ability to add creases as well. (1 minute)|


=====New SubD Reflect command, a symmetric copy=====

| [[https://youtu.be/T9tZ68Wk6oM|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:subd-reflect-giuseppe.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | In this short tutorial, Giuseppe Massoni quickly walks us through Rhino's 7 new command: Reflect. This command allows you to make a symmetric copy of the object while maintaining the smooth connection between the mirrored copies. A much needed tool for SubD sculpting.(1 minute)|


=====Building Modeling with SubD Tools in Rhino 7=====

| [[https://youtu.be/T9tZ68Wk6oM|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:rhino7-subd-building.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwImuwbI4lKk544-FS7A2Yw|How to Rhino]] takes a look at Rhino 7 Work in Progress version and new SubD tools that are on a good track to replace T-splines plugin for Rhino 5 that was the king of SubD modeling. In this tutorial, we will be going over some simple techniques using these new Rhino modeling tools in order to create this conceptual project designed by @archihab.|


=====Reverse engineering surfaces with SubD=====

| [[https://youtu.be/WpaSq2j-Mvk|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:rhino7-subd-reverse-last.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | Using rhino v7 wip this video shows the combination of quadremesh and SubD to converted meshes to nurbs. (59'47")|


=====Rhino Grasshopper Sub D Component=====

| [[https://youtu.be/3ouWVibHL5Y|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:how-to-rhino-subd-grasshopper.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | From [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwImuwbI4lKk544-FS7A2Yw|How to Rhino]] youtube channel, go through basic manipulation of Sub-D component in both Rhino and Grasshopper and how to quickly edit free-form geometry. This particular project that was used as inspiration is designed by Daniel Widrig for Duhamel Competition in Germany. (9'31")|

=====Rhino wip 7 subdivision "append"=====

| [[https://youtu.be/EH397oGmdo4|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:rhino7-subd-append-video.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | Giorgio Gurioli shows how to use the Append command with Rhino 7 SubD geometry. (6 minutes)|
