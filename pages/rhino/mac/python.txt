====== Python Scripting in Mac Rhino ======
Mac Rhino supports a test plug-in that adds Python scripting to Rhino. In order to add this support, you must:

  - [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/wenatchee/5.0/wip|Install the latest OSX Rhino release]]
  - Run this new version of Rhino. \\ This will register the .macrhi extension with the Rhino application. You only need to do this once. Now double-clicking any .macrhi file will launch Rhino.
  - [[http://download.rhino3d.com/IronPython/5.0/wip/download/|Download the IronPython .macrhi plug-in installer]]. \\ This is a Mac Rhino plug-in installer for Python. 
  - Double-click the file to install the plug-in in Rhino. \\ Mac Rhino will start and install the plug-in.
  - Shut down and restart Rhino. \\ You should now have a new **RunPythonScript** command.

====RunPythonScript command====
There are two versions of this command:

**RunPythonScript** - Displays a File Open dialog that lets you pick a python script (.py file.) The plug-in includes a set of sample scripts that you can run, and the dialog should point you to this folder the first time you run it.

**-RunPythonScript** - The "dashed" version of this command lets you type a script filename. If the script exists in the Scripts directory on your computer it will be executed. You can use the period to run a script in a subdirectory of the Scripts directory. For example, if you wanted to run the CurveLength.py file in the samples subdirectory you could type samples.curvelength at the prompt.

**Note**: All of the samples included in this plug-in should work on both [[http://mac.rhino3d.com|Mac Rhino WIP]] and [[http://www.rhino3d.com/|Windows Rhino 5]].
