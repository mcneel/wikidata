===== Question =====
We are putting together an installer for our Rhino 5 plug-in. We'd like to know how we can, programatically, get Rhino's installation folder.

===== Answer =====
==== Rhino 5 64-bit ====
If you are looking for Rhino 5 64-bit, then you can find the location of Rhino's installation folder by looking in the Windows Registry in this location:

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   SOFTWARE\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0x64\Install
Name:  InstallPath
Type:  REG_SZ
</code>

==== Rhino 5 32-bit ====
If you are looking for Rhino 5 32-bit on a system running a 64-bit version of Windows, then you can find the location of Rhino's installation folder by looking in the Windows Registry in this location:

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\Install
Name:  InstallPath
Type:  REG_SZ
</code>

If you are looking for Rhino 5 32-bit on a system running a 32-bit version of Windows, then you can find the location of Rhino's installation folder by looking in the Windows Registry in this location:

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   SOFTWARE\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\Install
Name:  InstallPath
Type:  REG_SZ
</code>
