====== Can I use Paneling Tools (Rhino 5 for Mac) ======
> **Summary:** //Does the plug-in Paneling Tools exist for Rhino 5 for Mac.//

Yes. PanelingTools plug-in is NOT part of the released Rhino 5 for Mac, but it is available as part of the [[http://www.rhino3d.com/go/download/rhino-for-mac/wip/latest|Rhino for Mac WIP]]. If you own a Rhino for Mac license, then you need to download and install the Rhino for Mac WIP to access Paneling Tools. Please note that the Rhino for Mac WIP is a Work-In-Progress, which means it includes the latest features and development, but it also means that there may be instability and bugs. New WIPs are released frequently as we add features and fix bugs. 

Note: In the WIP, there is no Paneling Tools menu and all of the commands are available through the command line only. Type “pt” to see all the Paneling Tools commands in the AutoComplete list.
