  - Go to Windows Explorer
  - In the address bar type **%APPDATA%**
  - There should be a long list of folders.  Go to **McNeel > Rhinoceros > 5.0 > Plug-ins** 
  - Find the folder that contains the name of you plug-in and delete that folder.

===Find the Common Files Location (Location 2)==
  - Close all Rhino applications
  - Go to Windows Explorer
  - Go to the **C:\Program Files\Common Files\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\Plug-ins**
  - Find the folder that contains the name of you plug-in and delete that folder.

===Find the additional Common Files location on 64-bit systems (Location 3)==
  - Close all Rhino applications
  - Go to Windows Explorer
  - Go to the **C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\Plug-ins**
  - Find the folder that contains the name of you plug-in and delete that folder.

**NOTE** - Once you restart Rhino, there may be an error at start-up, but it will be only a one time message.
