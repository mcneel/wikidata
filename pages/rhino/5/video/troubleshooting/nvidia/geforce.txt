====== NVIDIA GeForce Video Updates ======
These instructions are for computers that have NVIDIA GeForce graphics hardware. 

**To complete these instructions you must know:**
  - The card manufacturer.  This page is for NVIDIA Corporation cards.
  - The video card model.  This page is for GeForce models only.
  - The operating system of the computer. [[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-operating-system|Which Windows operating system am I running?]]

If you are not sure of any of these, please go to **[[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:failure|Rhino Video Troubleshooting]]** for more instructions.

> Before updating your video drivers we recommend creating a system restore point on your computer in case the changes need to be rolled back.  [[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-restore-faq#1TC=windows-7|Instructions to creating a system restore point.]]

=====Determine the NVIDIA driver version=====
  - Start <color red>**Rhino**</color>.
  - On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
  - Expand the **View** tab (located near the bottom of the list on the left), and then click **OpenGL**.
  - Look for the **Driver Version:** line.  It will have a long number that looks like <color grey>x.xx.xx.xxxx</color>  The last five digits of this number are the NVIDIA driver version. For instance, if the long Driver Version number is 8.17.11.9713, then the NVIDIA driver version is 197.13.
