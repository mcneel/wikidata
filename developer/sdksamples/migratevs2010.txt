====== Migrating to Visual Studio 2010 ======
===== Overview =====
On March 30, 2011, 64-bit Rhino 5.0 users were  upgraded to builds of Rhino 5.0 built with Visual Studio 2010.

32-bit builds of plug-ins will continue to build with Visual Studio 2005.

===== Why the change? =====
Rhino 4.0 and 32-bit builds of Rhino 5.0 are built with Visual Studio 2005. As of this writing, the 2005 compiler is two versions old, and is difficult to obtain. Because we can break the SDK with 64-bit builds of Rhino 5.0, we have decided to use the current version of the compiler, MFC, and development environment.

We expect that over time the 32-bit platform will become uncommon enough that 32-bit plug-in support will be unnecessary. We have no idea how long this will take.

===== What Changes =====
64-bit plug-ins use Visual Studio 2010 compiler tools, link with the 2010 Microsoft Platform SDK, and link with the C-Runtimes, MFC, and OpenMP from Visual Studio 2010.

32-bit plug-ins are compiled from within the 2010 IDE, but use the 2005 compiler tools, and the 2005 versions of C-Runtimes, MFC, etc. **Visual Studio 2005 must be installed to compile and debug 32-bit plug-ins.**

The Rhino 5.0 64-bit SDK installs tools to integrate the Visual Studio 2005 compiler tools with Visual Studio 2010 IDE.

===== What Users Need to Do =====
Unless you are asked by a developer to test a pre-release version of their plug-in against the new build of Rhino, you should wait until the Visual Studio 2010 Rhino 5.0 is officially released.

But, before that, you can contact your favorite plug-in vendors and make sure they are working toward having a release on March 30th 2011.
