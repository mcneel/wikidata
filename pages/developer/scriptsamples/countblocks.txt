=====Question=====

My customer has a document that contains hundreds of block definitions. How does he count all instances of all blocks at once, and not one by one? That is, I want to print out a report of all blocks and the number of instances.

=====Answer=====

See the following RhinoScript.

<code vb>
 Sub CountAllInstancesOfAllBlocks
   arrNames = Rhino.BlockNames(True)
   If IsArray(arrNames) Then
     For Each strName In arrNames
       Rhino.Print strName & " = " & CStr(Rhino.BlockInstanceCount(strName))
     Next
   End If
 End Sub
</code>
