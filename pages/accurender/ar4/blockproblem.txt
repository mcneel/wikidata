** Having problems rendering blocks or xrefs in [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2009? **



> **Summary:** //This problem is fixed in Service Release 4//

1. First check which date your AccuRender 4 version has. You do this by starting up [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] and by typing in ar4_about on the command line.

2. If the date is before 21/11/2008, you need to go to http://download.mcneel.com/accurender/4.0/sr and download the latest Service Release of AccuRender 4.
