Information on Presentations (this list and the content of each presentation may change):


----
PRESENTATION 1 - **McNeel U.S.** (Developers of Rhino)

Scott Davidson & Carlos Perez

What's new in Rhino 4 for Architects.

Quick review of the upcoming Rhino 4 release focusing on new features for Architects, Contractors and Fabricators.

  * "Improved modeling tools, including better variable-radius blend tools and improved Booleans.
  * "New editing tools, including direct polysurface (solids) editing tools and command history.
  * "Interface enhancements, including new SmartTrack™ technology and more advanced display options.
  * "Improved 2-D drawing tools, including line types, line weights, hidden lines, hatching, dimensions, leaders, page layouts, and printing/plotting.
  * "Better mesh support. All editing tools should work on mesh objects as well as on [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] objects.
  * "More robust third-party software developer tools development - RhinoArq and NPR rendering demonstrations show the direction some of this development is taking.

Also includes upcoming development projects that McNeel are working on.

PRESENTATION 2 - **EDAW** - Landscape, Planning & Urban Designers

www.edaw.com

EDAW is consistently ranked among the world's leading design firms, and boasts hundreds

of client and industry awards.

With over 1100 professionals working from a network of 25 offices worldwide, EDAW's multidisciplinary teams' perspective is both broad and specialized.

EDAW will demonstrate how Rhino continues to be invaluable tool in the following projects:

1 - London 2012 Olympic Bid, Lower Lee Valley Regeneration Masterplan.

2 - Garibaldi Repubblica in Milan, Italy.

3 - Pier Head Liverpool.  Plaza in front of the Three Graces.

4 - Regeneration of Blackpool Promenade

PRESENTATION 3 - **McNeel U.S.** (Developers of Rhino)

Andy Le Bihan

Next generation rendering in Rhino with news on Brazil, the (under development) high quality renderer from McNeel.

PRESENTATION 4 - **ASGVIS** (Developers of V-Ray for Rhino)

Damien Alomar

V-Ray for Rhino Presentation

Overview of V-Ray. What it is, A little bit of its history, and its features.

Includes section on migrating to V-Ray for Rhino from either Flamingo or V-Ray for Max.



----
PRESENTATION 5 - **Arup Advanced Geometry** Title - Tools for Projects

1. Generative (e.g. tiling, Crystal Project)

2. Form finding (e.g. smoothing, Arnhem Project)

3. Meshing and mapping (e.g. mapping, Alishan)

4. Interfacing using object and document data (e.g. Dublin T2)

5. Linking to analysis (e.g. GME)

General Topics include:

Automation with analysis software for structural/geometric optimisation

Automation of generating profiles for CNC cutting etc

Using scripting and development of their own Rhino plugins


----
PRESENTATION 6 - **Metropolitan Works**

Matthew Lewis & Marc Collinson

Overview of the latest digital manufacturing technologies now available at Metropolitan Works. Facilities include rapid prototyping, laser cutting, 3D scanning, CNC routing and digital printing. These facilities are available as a bureau service with charges based on production time. In addition to providing new technology for prototyping and manufacture, Metropolitan Works also offers a membership scheme, venue hire, training in CAD, and technical and business advice.

PRESENTATION 7 **Michael Ramage**

Architect and Lecturer at Cambridge University.

Michael designs and builds compound-curved masonry structures, modelling in Rhino and doing structural analysis in a 2D parametric

coordinate geometry package called Cabri.

He recently completed two domes and a staircase for an ecological conference center in Kent.

PRESENTATION 8 **McNeel U.S.** (Developers of Rhino)

David Rutten

New scripting editor being developed for Rhino v4.0


----
PRESENTATION 9 **Buro Happold SMART Group**

SMART, an analysis and research team spawned out of the Special Structures group in Buro Happold, has become a centre for advanced modelling and simulation. Some of the proud achievements of the team are the development of sophisticated modelling tools and software, ranging from Tensyl (formfinding) to SmartMove (crowd flow simulations).

The group has effectively used Rhino’s scripting and plugin capabilities to the fullest by incorporating it into the majority of its work. The presentation will demonstrate this through the example of Sidra Trees – a 250m long doubly curved steel structure forming signature entrance to the Convention Centre at Qatar Education City. Rhino has been used in virtually every stage of the design of this structure: preprocessing (tree form analysis, structural core mapping and interface with Ansys), surface smoothening, stiffener frame mapping, flattening, full electronic scheduling, and digital fabrication interface.

PRESENTATION 10 **McNeel U.S.** (Developers of Rhino)

Rajaa Issa

Introducing two Rhino 4 architectural plugins.

SolidTools plugin to directly manipulate extruded geometry through stretching faces, moving edges, creating and editing holes and Boolean extrusions.  The plugin has enhanced surface and curve editing tools such as soft editing, partial untriming and extending trimmed surfaces.

[[labs:archcut|ArchCut]] plugin provides tools for sectioning architectural models and generating paneling grids. Sectioning include tools to import section locations, create, update, 2D layout and report.  Paneling tools support a variety of paneling algorithms ranging from well-defined paneling directions to completely random paneling.

Hi Paul, All.

This looks like a truly wonderful effort. I'd love to follow up on any video footage of the presentations, and/or printed matter if possible. Wish I was within a days' drive of this one.

Sincerely,

Jonathan
