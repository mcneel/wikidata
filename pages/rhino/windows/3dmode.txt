====== AR/VR in Rhino 7 & 8 ======

===== Option 1: Rhino VR Plugin =====

Download [[here|https://github.com/mcneel/RhinoVR]]
It requires an OpenVR compatible VR headset.

===== Option 2: Quad Buffering 3DMode =====

Windows Rhino 7 & 8 now supports "Quad Buffering" which is what is needed for Passive/Active stereo viewing.

The Quad Buffering support in V8 is for hardware like **PluraVision 3D** and passive stereo viewing from people like **Schneider Digital**.

===== Configuration =====
//Note: Close Rhino. You must get the computer all setup for stereo viewing prior to starting Rhino//

==== Windows Setting ====

Quad Buffering does this need to be turned on in Rhino 8 and requires you enable "3D mode" in Windows display settings, as well as the GPU manufacturer's control panel.

==== Graphics Card Setting ==== 
GPU control panel should have some kind of Stereo option.

Here is the nvidia Control Panel option.

Check is the NVIdia control panel and see if there are Stereo options shown above. Note: You will not be able to enable it from there since this is now a Windows settings. Notice in my screenshot of NVidia's control panel it says "Enabled" but it's grayed out...that's because I already enabled "3D display mode" in the Windows->Display settings.
