====== Incentives and Expected Practical Outcomes An ART Certification ======
An ART certification is not necessary to teach Rhino. In 1999, customers and teachers asked McNeel to come up with a way to certify a Rhino trainer for their Rhino knowledge and ability to teach Rhino. This includes familiarity with Rhino resources, support forum and other materials. The ART and ARTC certification were established in 2000.

There are basic [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/art_requirements|ART requirements.]] and your region may require additional qualifications. When you have completed the requirements, your application will be reviewed by McNeel staff, and when complete, you will be officially notified. You will receive a private login to **MyMcNeel**. **MyMcNeel** is where you post your classes to our Training web page. Only ART/ARTC can post their classes to our main Learn page and will be listed as offering custom training. 

Some potential students may ask if you are certified. 
You can add your new ART to your Linkedin and your list of other commercial certifications. 
Some employers require it for in house Rhino training. 

Marketing and technical support are asked questions about training daily about training. A training newsletter is  also published each month that highlights the upcoming classes by ARTs and ARTC on the Rhino schedule. If requested, will also publish Rhino News Blogs posts for any special training that you have scheduled. 

McNeel does not present regularly scheduled Level 1 & Level 2 training anymore. Our ARTs and ARTC do that training,  mostly online.  

You may ask for opinions of other users, recommendations or "testimonies" on the [[https://discourse.mcneel.com/|Rhino Support Forum]]. We also get feedback from our ARTs that this certification adds value and brings attention to their preparedness to teach Rhino.

In summary, an ART is not required to just do Rhino classes, but it is required to post your Rhino classes to our **[[https://www.rhino3d.com/training/United_States/|Learn]]** page of the rhino3d.com web site.
