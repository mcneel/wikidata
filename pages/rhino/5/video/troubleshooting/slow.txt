======Video Troubleshooting: Performance ======
Rhino 5 can be slow when there's too much work for your graphics card to do.

Here are some ideas for working on large models:
  * Create custom render meshes for the objects in your model. Small parts can often have less polygons in their render mesh and still look smooth from a distance. Custom mesh control per object can be found in the Object Properties panel. 
  * Turn off the display of Isocurves in the Display panel. This changes the active display mode only. 
  * If you are working with a polygonal mesh model, turn off the display of mesh wires when using shaded display modes.  
  * If you have many repeated objects in the model and don't need them to be NURBS, convert them all to meshes and then join these into one mesh object. Don't forget to then hide the original NURBS objects too. 
  * Reset your display mode to the default settings in Options>Rhino Options>View>Display Modes.
