====== I cannot find my license key for Rhino ======

The Rhino license key is essential to establishing ownership of Rhino. License keys are a valuable part of the Rhino license. Keep them in a secure place.

If you owned Rhino Version 1, 2 or 3, the CD was shipped in a pocket in the back of the User's Guide book, so make sure you check your bookcase. The User's Guide was about 1" (2.5 cm) thick with a glossy black cover, prominent Rhino logo on the front. Rhino Version 4 was shipped in a DVD case with a black label. Rhino 5 licenses and above were shipped by email. 

If you are unable to locate your copy of Rhino, we may be able to help find your license key code if you registered your product. If you bypassed registration, we will not have any record. We did not trace product serial numbers upon shipment, so your order number will not help us.  

Please note there is no CD replacement available for Rhino Versions 1 or 2 due to contractual obligations for core programming that we licensed from a third party at that time. 

If you have exhausted your search for the physical product, there are replacement options for the full commercial version. **Send us an [[mailto:sales@mcneel.com|email]]** or [[https://www.rhino3d.com/support/|call]] the closest regional office for details.
