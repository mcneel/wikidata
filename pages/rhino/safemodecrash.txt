====Safe Mode Crash====

A user running Rhino V4 SR9 on a 64-bit WinXP system reported crashing when clicking any toolbar icon. He had the Command Help window open that displays Help file topics and a Flash video when a command is clicked.

Closing the CommandHelp window avoided the crash. Unfortunately, the user did not have Admin rights on the computer so we could not install an updated Flash player plug-in for the MS Internet Explorer that the CommandHelp tool uses.
