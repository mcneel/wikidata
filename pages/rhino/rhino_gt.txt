Come and learn Rhino, find out about best practices for using Rhino in your classroom, work with Rhino experts, and develop your own models in Rhino for 3D printing.

**[[https://www.construct3dconf.com/|Construct3D 2018]]** is a 3D printing, digital fabrication conference, and expo focused on academic use, best practices, and professional development opportunities for faculty, staff, and students. 

===== Details =====

  * **When:**  Friday, October 5, 2018 (All Day)
  * **Where:**  [[https://construct3d2018.sched.com/event/G4eK/rhino-for-educators-workshop|Construct3D 2018, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA]]

  * **Sign up [[https://www.construct3dconf.com/registration-rates-and-form/|here!]]**

In this comprehensive, one-day introductory class, you will learn the basics of creating and editing accurate 3-D models. This fast-moving class covers how to start using Rhino to develop models for both rendering and digital fabrication. The day will start with an introduction and progress rapidly to more advanced surfacing commands and preparing models for 3D printing. This class is designed to be "hand on." However, feel free to join us even if you do not have a computer.

===== What to bring =====
  * A Windows laptop running **[[https://www.rhino3d.com/download|Rhinos 6 for Windows]]**, or
  * An Apple laptop running **[[https://www.rhino3d.com/download|Rhino 5 for Mac]]**.
  * A three-button mouse (important).

//**Note, the instructor will be using Rhino 6 for Windows**.//

If you have a Windows laptop and do not have **Rhino 6 for Windows**, you can download and install the **[[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-windows/6/evaluation|free 90-day evaluation]]**.

If you have Apple laptop and do not have **Rhino 5 for Mac**, you can download and install the **[[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5/evaluation|free 90-day evaluation]]**.


==== Expected Outcomes ====
After this course the student is expected to be able to:
  * Utilize the features of the Rhino user interface;
  * Create basic graphic objects; lines, circles, arcs, curves, surfaces, and solids.
  * Model with precision.
  * Modify curves and surfaces with edit commands and Gumball.
  * Use control point editing to modify curves and surfaces.
  * Export models to STL, and import models from different file formats.
  * Render the model using Rhino Render.
  * 3D Printing.
  * Rhino Training Guides (Level 1 and Level 2 Curriculum can be used by your school for free).
