======License Manager Updates for Rhino 5 SR6======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses Rhino 5 and Zoo 5 changes found in Service Release 6.//

=====Overview=====
With the release of Rhino 5, a new and improved version of the network license manager, [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/home|Zoo 5]], was also released.

Bongo, Brazil, Flamingo, and Penguin do not support Zoo 5 prior to Service Release 6 (SR6).

With both **Rhino 5 SR6** and **Zoo 5 SR6** installed, you can now use a single Zoo 5 server to float the following product licenses:

  * Bongo 2.0
  * Brazil 2.0
  * Flamingo nXt
  * Penguin 2.0
  * Rhino 5

Note, the following products **will not** work with Zoo 5 SR6:
  * Bongo 1.0
  * Flamingo 1.0
  * Flamingo 1.1
  * Flamingo 2.0
  * Penguin 1.0
  * Penguin 1.1
  * Rhino 4.0

=====More information=====
Rhino 5 SR6 includes a new license manager client (RhinoLM5). This replaces the old license manager client (RhinoLM).

When a supported McNeel plug-in product needs a license from a Zoo server, RhinoLM5 checks to see if the system is configured to use a Zoo 5 server. If configured, RhinoLM5 attempts to obtain a license from the Zoo 5 server. If no license was obtained from the Zoo 5 server, or if the Zoo 5 server was not found, then RhinoLM5 tries to obtain a license from the Zoo 4.0 server.

=====Technical support=====
Rhino and McNeel plug-in products use a license manager client to communicate with Zoo servers.

The file name of the license manager client used to access Zoo 4.0 servers is **RhinoLM.exe**, and it is installed in the following folder:

<code>
%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\McNeel Shared\License Manager
</code>

The file name of the new license manager client file, included with Rhino 5 SR6, is **RhinoLM5.exe**, and it is installed in the same folder.

If you need to revert back to the old license manager, you can run **RegRhinoLM4.exe**, which is found in the same folder.

If you need to re-register the new license manager, you can run **RegRhinoLM5.exe**. For example, if you install Rhino 5 SR5 and then you install Flamingo nXt, then you will need to run **RegRhinoLM5.exe**, as the Flamingo nXt installer will always register the old license manager.
