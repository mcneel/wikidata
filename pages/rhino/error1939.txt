=====Problem=====
I get Error 1939 'Invalid command line argument'. 

=====Cause====
One common cause for this error with the Rhino 5 installer is the use of extra double-quotes (") when entering user information during the setup.

=====Answer=====
When you enter your name and other user information, do not type any double quotes, for example typing something like: 

''Bob "Grumpy" Ross'' 

as a user name would cause this error.
