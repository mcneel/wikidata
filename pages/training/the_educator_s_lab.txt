====== The Educator's Lab ======

==== Welcome and Overview ====

The Educator’s Lab is a collaborative space for teachers who want to start, or are already teaching Rhino and Grasshopper. It’s a place to build confidence with the tools, stay up to date with new developments, grow as an educator, ask questions, get support, and connect with a community of peers working at the intersection of design, technology, and education.


==== Why Teach Rhino? ====

Anyone can teach Rhino, and we encourage you to. It’s not just another 3D tool. Rhino is a flexible, all-in-one platform where students can sketch, draft, model, render, fabricate, simulate, and code using Grasshopper. It also includes tools like Kangaroo for live physics and Rhino.Inside.Revit for advanced workflows.

Unlike subscription-based software, Rhino uses a permanent license model. For short courses, students can use a [[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/evaluation/|90-day full-featured evaluation]]. Teaching Rhino gives students one powerful tool to take a project from start to finish, with access to a rich ecosystem of plugins that add specialized tools for specific and professional workflows.
