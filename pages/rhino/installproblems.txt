**Important note:** You can avoid nearly all the problems and fixes listed on this page if, before installing Rhino, Windows is fully up-to-date with the **important updates** using **[[http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/|Windows Update]]**.

Once Windows update is open on the computer, click on the Check for Updates button. After installing new updates, please try and install Rhino again.

If the Windows update has stalled, shows an error, or does not seem to finish installing the updates, go to [[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2700567|Microsoft Update freezes]].
