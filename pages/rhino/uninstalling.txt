====== Manually Uninstalling Rhino 4.0 ======

\\

====Problem====
During the startup, install or uninstall of Rhino, you get an error message like this:

**The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable.**

**Click OK to try again, or enter an alternate path to a folder containing the installation package '<filename>.MSI' in the box below.**


This applies to Rhino 4.0 and Rhino 5.

====Cause====
The Windows Installer cache cannot find a file or registry key required for uninstall. This is a common problem caused by the Windows Installer Service. The best solution is to use **Windows Install Clean Up** to thoroughly remove the previous installation. After you clean up the previous install, you will be able to reinstall Rhino and get a valid install.


====Resolution====
Manually remove Rhino and the Windows Installer registration for the product.

===Try standard Program Uninstall==
  - Go to Windows Start menu.
  - Select **Control Panel**.
  - Select **Add/Remove programs**.
  - Find any Rhinoceros 4.0 entries and select uninstall.


**Note:** You should only do the following procedures if uninstall fails from the Programs and Features section of Control Panel.

  
===Delete the Rhino install folder===
  - Browse to //C:\Program Files\//.
  - Delete **Rhinoceros 4.0** or **Rhinoceros 4.0 Evaluation**.
  
===Delete Registry Keys:===
  - Open the **Registry Editor**.
  - Browse to //HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros//.
  - Delete the **4.0** Key.
  - Browse to //HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros//.
  - Delete the **4.0** Key.
