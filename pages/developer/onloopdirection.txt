======Brep Loop and Edge Directions======

=====Question=====
Is there a function to query if a loop **ON_BrepLoop** is reversed on the face **ON_BrepFace**? In other words, whether the boundary of the face agrees with or opposes that of the corresponding loop?

Also, is there a way to query if the edge **ON_BrepEdge** direction is reversed? Or, whether an edge curve agrees with the start and end vertices?


=====Answer=====
Loops are always oriented so that the active region of the face is to the left of the 2D curve. Thus, outer loops are oriented counter-clockwise and inner loops are oriented clockwise.

Also, to determine whether or not an edge is reversed, use **ON_BrepEdge::ProxyCurveIsReversed()**. See opennurbs_curveproxy.h for details.
