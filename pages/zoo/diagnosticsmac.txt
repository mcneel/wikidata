**[[https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac|Terminal]]** runs on a **Rhino for Mac** workstation. It provides command line access to several useful network diagnostics to troubleshoot connectivity issues between Rhino for Mac workstations and Zoo servers.

  
=====Diagnostics=====
The Network Utility provides these useful network tests:

1. **ping:** The ping diagnostics utility is the primary TCP/IP tool used to troubleshoot connectivity, reachability, and name resolution. Ping verifies IP-level connectivity to another TCP/IP computer by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages. Receipts of corresponding Echo Reply messages are displayed, along with round-trip times.

''ping zoo.mcneel.com''

Successful ping response looks like:

<code>
> ping zoo.mcneel.com
PING zoo.mcneel.com (192.168.0.100): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.22.0.15: icmp_seq=0 ttl=127 time=9.981 ms
64 bytes from 10.22.0.15: icmp_seq=1 ttl=127 time=8.630 ms
64 bytes from 10.22.0.15: icmp_seq=2 ttl=127 time=9.774 ms
</code>

Failed ping response looks like:

<code>
> ping zoo.mcneel.com
PING zoo.mcneel.com (192.168.0.100): 56 data bytes
Request timeout for icmp_seq 0
Request timeout for icmp_seq 1
Request timeout for icmp_seq 2
Request timeout for icmp_seq 3
</code>

Press **Ctrl+C** to cancel the **ping** command.

2. **nslookup:** The DNS Lookup diagnostic utility displays information that you can use to diagnose Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure.

''nslookup zoo.mcneel.com''

Successful ''nslookup'' response looks like:

<code>
> nslookup zoo.mcneel.com
Server:		192.168.0.1
Address:	192.168.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	zoo.mcneel.com
Address: 192.168.0.100
</code> 

Failed ''nslookup'' response looks like:
<code>
> nslookup zoo.mcneel.com
** server can't find zoo.mcneel.com: NXDOMAIN
</code> 


3.  **Traceroute:** The Trace Route diagnostic utility determines the route taken to a destination by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo packets with varying IP Time-To-Live (TTL) values to the destination. Each router along the path is required to decrement the TTL on a packet by at least 1 before forwarding it, so the TTL is effectively a hop count. When the TTL on a packet reaches 0, the router should send an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source computer.

''traceroute zoo.mcneel.com''

Successful ''traceroute'' response looks like:

<code>
> traceroute zoo.mcneel.com
traceroute to zoo.mcneel.com (192.168.0.100), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets
 1  192.168.0.100 (192.168.0.100)  9.391 ms  6.558 ms  8.538 ms

</code> 

Failed ''traceroute'' response looks like:
<code>
> traceroute zoo.mcneel.com
traceroute to zoo.mcneel.com (192.168.0.100), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets
1.  * * *
</code> 


4. **Port Scan (nc):** The Port Scan test scans for open TCP ports. In the case of the Zoo, you will want to scan for TCP Port 80.

''nc -z -v zoo.mcneel.com 80''

Successful ''netcat'' response:

<code>
> nc -z -v zoo.mcneel.com 80
Connection to zoo.mcneel.com port 80 [tcp/http] succeeded!
</code>

Failed ''netcat'' response:

netcat will not return. To cancel, press **Ctrl+C**


//If this test fails, then make sure the Zoo server service is running. You can do this by using either ZooAdmin.exe or the Services applet in Control Panel. Also, make sure __[[zoo:window7firewall|TCP Port 80 is open on any firewall software]],__ for both incoming and outgoing traffic, running on the Zoo system.//
