====== Centered Grid ======
> **Summary:** //Dynamic grid plugin for Rhino4//

\\

This is a little plugin for Rhino4 which will draw the grid centered in the viewport rather than linked to the c-plane origin. It does not affect the original Rhino grid (i.e. both can co-exist) but it does use mostly the same settings (colour, line interval, extents etc.)

This plugin comes with two commands:

  * CenteredGrid        (for quickly enabling/disabing the grid) 
  * CenteredGridOptions   (controlling the grid behaviour)

The above image shows a centered grid near the c-plane origin. Note that the axis are pushed towards the edge (this never happens with the original grid). Also, the centered grid has a black border drawn around it. When the origin of the c-plane is no longer contained within the centered grid, an anchor line is drawn towards the origin:

Both the anchor line and the border can be disabled via the Ornaments option in the CenteredGridOptions command.
