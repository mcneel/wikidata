====== Calibrating Zoom 1to1 ======

You can calibrate Zoom 1To1 (**Zoom1To1Calibrate** command) more accurately by using the dpi (actually, pixels per inch) or the dot pitch of your particular monitor than by measuring the calibration bar with a ruler on screen. 

A Dot Pitch and DPI caclculator is available [[http://pxcalc.com/|here.]]

There are also tables of known monitor resolutions available, for example {{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_pitch|here.}}


**Example:** My laptop screen is 1920 by 1080 and 15.6 inches on the diagonal. The DPI is shown as 141.21. The calibration bar displayed by Zoom1To1Calibrate is 478 pixels long, so 478 pixels/141.21 pixels per inch = 3.385 inches, is what I enter as the length of the bar. 

To set the length of the calibration bar in millimeters, use the dot pitch number, rather than DPI, in my case .1799mm.  So - (478 pixels) X (.1799 mm per pixel) = 85.99 millimeters as the bar length.
