> **Summary:** //a free plugin to create UV-maps from meshes with texture coordinates//

\\

=====What is TxTemplate ?=====
TxTemplate is an image based unwrapper for meshes (or a RenderMesh) with UV-texture coordinates. TxTemplate was written to create accurate drawing templates or UV-masks with a layered texture including transparency. This plugin unwraps the UV-coordinates identical to the UnwrapRenderMesh and [[labs:uvcwrap|UVcWrap]] plugins. The main difference is that the result is an image preview or file.

\\

=====Requirements=====

To install and run the TxTemplate plugin, the following items are required:

  - Rhinoceros 4.0 SR7 or 5 (WIP) \\
  - Internet Explorer 7 or 8 (32bit) \\
  - RhPicture plugin



It is necessary to have the RhPicture plugin also known as [[developer:rhinoscriptimageextension|GDI Bitmap extension for Rhinoscript]] properly installed ! This plugin was tested with Windows XP (x64 and x86) only.

\\

=====Installation=====

Download and extract the TxTemplate.rhp plugin file anywhere, eg. into your [[rhino:rhinoceros|RhinoCeros]] 4.0 plugins directory.

1. Open Rhino, install the TxTemplate.rhp plugin through the Plugin Manager \\
2. Select a mesh or rendermesh \\
3. Type TxTemplate into the commandline to start

===== Example files=====
[[http://www.cg3d.de/pub/TxTemplate/Examples/TxTemplateExample.zip|Download example scene]] with assigned (baked) texture. It might be needed to reassign the texture if it is not shown in your rendered viewport display. Once you have opened the Rhino file, run TxTemplate and click the Show button in the TxTemplate dialog.

\\

===== Usage and tips=====

TxTemplate draws UV maps containing all mesh information in the same order as shown in the user interface. The more elements have to be drawn, the longer it takes to generate the UV map. For larger meshes above 20.000 faces, it is recommended to enable only drawing of mesh borders and use a transparent background.

- To restore user interface default settings, use the R-key. \\
- Use the S-key or Enter to Show the image. \\
- Use the F-key to quickly save the image to a file. \\
- TxTemplate works best with packed texture coordinates 

\\

=====Known issues=====

- can draw overlaps if the mesh texture coordinates overlap (eg. with unpacked texture coordinates or texture projections) \\
- can create blank images if the texture coordinates are not within a range between 0 and 1.
