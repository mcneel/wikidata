PRODUCT DESIGN

Phil Cook - Form Foundry Limited [[http://www.formfoundry.co.uk|(www.formfoundry.co.uk)]]

Phil Cook runs Form Foundry, a successful Cheshire based product design consultancy. Phil has twenty years of professional design experience and his work has taken him across Europe the United States and the Far East.

Working on a diverse range of products for national and international brands including BT, Johnston Sweepers, Ransomes Jacobsen, REM UK, Ademco, LK Group and Claas, Phil has amassed a wealth of experience with various manufacturing techniques and processes.

Phil has been using Rhinoceros® since v1 for all his 3D modelling and it has it has now become a central part of the Form Foundry design process.

“I use Rhino in a number of different ways; it’s a great tool for producing quick concept and styling models where a range of ideas need to be created in a short amount of time but it’s also accurate and stable enough to produce fully detailed component models for rapid prototyping and final production tooling. The import and export capabilities are superb and gives us interoperability with our client’s varying solid modelling software as well as the ability to export files in various formats for downstream production and tooling”

MARINE LEISURE INDUSTRY

Rupert Lorraine - Kingfisher Boats [[http://www.kingfisher-boats.co.uk|(www.kingfisher-boats.co.uk)]]

Kingfisher Boats turned to the University of Plymouth’s Knowledge Transfer Partnerships team and Rupert Lorraine, a first class graduate of Marine Sports Technology, in November 2004 to help them realise their goal in implementing the correct infrastructure to manufacture a new sports boat for the leisure sector. This three year project aims to bring 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) technology and enhanced composites manufacturing processes to Kingfisher via the transfer of skills and expertise from the Universities knowledge base.

Within 3 months Rhino had become the sole design resource at Kingfisher, and the system has played a pivotal role in the development and manufacture of the new ‘Sport Explorer’; recently launched at the Southampton Boatshow in September.

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN & ENGINEERING

Keith Wilkinson - tensARC [[http://www.tensarc.co.uk|(www.tensarc.co.uk)]]

tensARC are a tensile fabric design and engineering company specialising in deployable tensile structures.  They have been using Rhino since their formation in 2001.

tensARC's use of rhino and flamingo is extremely varied from production of concept models through to fabrication models and drawings.  Over the last 3 years they have used Flamingo extensively to produce images to sell ideas to clients and communicate design intent to other designers.  At first Flamingo seemed limited but after little preserverence its true potential to provide great images from very simple setups became apparent.

This presentation aims to look at the single most signifcant element for them in terms of producing quaility images - GI (Global Illumination), how this can be faked in Flamingo and how this differs from traditional ambient light settings.  Keith will focus on architectural and product renderings although it will touch on interiors to some extent.

AUTOMOTIVE - DUMMY POSITIONING

Dr William Tiu - University of Hertfordshire

Use of Rhino as an aid for Dummy Positioning

MADYMO is a simulation package used by the automotive industry to predict the injuries of the occupant during a frontal crash. The occupant is modelled as series of rigid bodies connected together by spherical and universal joints.

One of the tasks that occupies the time of a simulation engineer is positioning the dummy onto the seat and then adjust all the angle of the joints to replicate the posture of a person in a driving mode.

The scripts written within Rhino allows the dummy model to be imported and then interactive adjustment can be made by using the translational and rotational facilities within the program.  This has minimised the time required to carry out this process.

PUBLIC ART

John Marshall - rootoftwo [[http://www.rootoftwo.com|(www.rootoftwo.com)]]

Marshall is undertaking research into the notion that digital tools such as Rhinoceros® enable new sets of creative, cultural and economic conditions for artists, architects, and designers at The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen.  He has been working with sculptor Malcolm Cochran using Rhinoceros® as a design and visualisation tool for large scale public art projects.  "Private Passage" is a 29' wine bottle made of steel and coated with zinc and bronze with the recreation of a cabin from the original Queen Mary inside of it situated in Clinton Cove Park, New York.  The interior, viewed through portholes and openings in the neck and bottom ends of the bottle, is made of stainless steel and mimics the stateroom of the luxury liner.  Dedicated on Thursday 19th May, 2005 the park is adjacent to the piers where the Queen Mary used to berth.  This presentation will look at the contribution made by Rhinoceros® in the realisation of this public art work.

rootoftwo is an transdisciplinary arts practice based in Manchester and Edinburgh, UK dedicated to the production of contemporary artworks focused on the urban environment and electronic culture. Specifically, rootoftwo researches, develops, produces, and exhibits contemporary artworks, which incorporate emerging art forms and technology. In addition to this, rootoftwo undertakes freelance work in graphic/3D design, web design, art and technology consulting, curating and arts administration/project coordination.

Using Rhino to manipulate faceted data for simulation applications

James Farrar - WildeFEA Ltd [[http://www.wildefea.co.uk|(www.wildefea.co.uk)]]

Presentation on the use of Rhino for manipulation of facted/stl data for use in various Simulation applications.

James will be highlighting areas in both the Biomedical and manufacturing industries where Rhino tools have or could be applied in the world of simulation where faceted data manipulation is required. Biomedical examples will include using Rhino to take 2D slices of stl scan data of a hip bone for a hip implant study and a crash study of a human skull. Metalforming applications include using the Bonus tools to repair bad stl die geometry in preparation for a DEFORM forging simulation.
