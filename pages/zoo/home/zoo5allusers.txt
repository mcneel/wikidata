====== Set the Zoo 5 for all users ======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //The instruction of setting the Zoo 5 for all users on a Rhino client computer.//

===== Issue =====
I have several users on a Rhino client computer. I have to set the Zoo server IP/name in every user. Can I set the Zoo server once for all users?
\\
\\
===== Cause =====
When you use a double-click to run Rhino 5 and set the Zoo server, the Zoo server information is added to Windows Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER. **This is for the current user only.**
\\
\\
===== Solution =====
Right-click the Rhino 5 shortcut icon, select **Run as administrator** and set the Zoo server. The Zoo server information is added to Windows Registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. **This is for all users.**
\\
\\
===== Notes =====
  * Users can use a double-click as usual to run Rhino in the future.
  * Rhino 5 network node finds the Zoo server information under HKEY_CURRENT_USER first. When it's empty there, Rhino finds it under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
  * If the Zoo server has been set under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, the Zoo server set under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE is always ignored, even though when the Zoo server set under HKEY_CURRENT_USER dose not run.
