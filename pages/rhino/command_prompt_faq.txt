====== Command Prompt Missing in Rhino 4 ======
//Rhino 4 only.//

**Problem:** Your Rhino Command Prompt is not visible on your computer screen.

==== The Command Prompt Command====
In the Rhino application, type **CommandPrompt**. 
This will reset to dock at the top, and change it from hidden to visible. This will not resize or change an error in the Window size. 

  - Command: **CommandPrompt** <Enter>
  - Choose command prompt option ( Position=Top  Show=Yes ):**P**
  - Position <Top> ( Top  Bottom  Floating  Toggle ): **T**
  - Choose command prompt option ( Position=Top  Show=Yes ): **S**
  - Show <Yes> ( Yes  No  Toggle ): **Y**
  - Choose command prompt option ( Position=Top  Show=Yes ):<Enter>

====Update the Registry====

If the above procedure does not reset the command prompt window, download the file below. This registry file will change the size and location of the command prompt windows back to the installation default.
