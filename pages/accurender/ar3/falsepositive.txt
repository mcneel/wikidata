====== Problem: Your Virus Scanner thinks the AR3 installer is a Virus ======



There is nothing wrong with the installer, itâ€™s a false positive.

Some of the installers that can alert you are:

upar3.exe  -  AccuRender 3.1 Service Release Build 268

RmaCloseApp.exe  located in C:\Program Files\accuren3\Backup\

If you are unsure about an AccuRender installer, please contact McNeel tech support <tech@mcneel.com> for more information.
