====== Set the Zoo 5 for all users ======

> **Summary:** //The instruction of setting the Zoo 5 for all users on a Rhino client computer.//

===== Issue =====
I have several users on a Rhino client computer. I have to set the Zoo server IP/name in every user. Can I set the Zoo server once for all users?
\\ \\

===== Cause =====
When you use a double-click to run Rhino 5 and set the Zoo server, the Zoo server information is added to Windows Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER. **This is for the current user only.**
\\ \\

===== Solution =====
Right-click the Rhino 5 shortcut icon, select "Run as administrator" and set the Zoo server. The Zoo server information is added to Windows Registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. **This is for all users.** Users can use a double-click to run Rhino as usual in the future.
\\ \\

**Note:** Rhino 5 finds the Zoo information under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE first and then HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
