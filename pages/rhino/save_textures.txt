====== Save texture in 3dm ======

When saving a new 3dm file, there is the "Save textures" checkbox.

  * Enable this option to embed textures (images) used by materials, environments, and decals into the 3dm file.
  * Disable this option if you do not want images embedded in a 3dm file.
  * When Rhino opens a 3dm file that refers to an image in a material, environment, or decal, it searches for these images in these locations:
  *   * The folder where the 3dm file is stored and its sub-folders.
  *   * The folders set in Options > Files > Search Paths and their sub-folders.
  *   * The folders set in Preferences > Files and their sub-folders.
If the images cannot be found and they were embedded into the 3dm file, they will be extracted into the *_embedded_files folder in the same location as the 3dm file. If the file was saved with the option unchecked, the images will be reported as missing when the file is opened and will offer the user to find the location manually.
