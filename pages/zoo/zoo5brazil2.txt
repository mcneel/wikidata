======Brazil 2.0 and the Zoo======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses how to use Brazil 2.0 with Zoo 5.//

=====Overview=====
[[http://brazil.rhino3d.com/|Brazil 2.0]] can be used with either Rhino 4.0 or Rhino 5. Because of this, [[http://brazil.rhino3d.com/|Brazil 2.0]] network licenses can be served by either [[zoo:zoo4|Zoo 4.0]], Rhino 4.0's network license manager, or [[zoo:home|Zoo 5]], Rhino 5's network license manager.

=====More Information=====
Upon initial installation, [[http://brazil.rhino3d.com/|Brazil 2.0]] is configured to use a [[zoo:zoo4|Zoo 4.0]] server for network licensing. 

To reconfigure [[http://brazil.rhino3d.com/|Brazil 2.0]] to use a [[zoo:home|Zoo 5]] server for network licensing, you will need to run a utility program.

In Explorer on the Rhino workstation, navigate to the following folder:

====64-bit Windows====
<code>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\McNeel Shared\License Manager
</code>

====32-bit Windows====
<code>
C:\Program Files\Common Files\McNeel Shared\License Manager
</code>

To configure [[http://brazil.rhino3d.com/|Brazil 2.0]] to use a [[zoo:home|Zoo 5]] server, run the **RegRhinoLM5.exe** utility.

To configure [[http://brazil.rhino3d.com/|Brazil 2.0]] to use a [[zoo:zoo4|Zoo 4.0]] server, run the **RegRhinoLM4.exe** utility.

This change needs to be done one each Rhino workstation that is being served by the Zoo.
