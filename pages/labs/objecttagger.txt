====== ObjectTagger ======
> **Summary:** //Object User Tag plugin for Rhino4 and 5//

\\

=====Purpose=====

This plugin allows you to attach, detach, search and view custom tags. It is a very early beta version with a lot of missing functionality and quite probably some serious bugs. Do not use this on important files!
