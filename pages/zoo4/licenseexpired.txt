=====Question=====

We are having difficulties getting Rhino 4.0 working in network-node mode on our Windows 7 64-bit workstations.  We have one workstation that is working and that had SR8. The others that are not working are SR9.

When starting Rhino 4.0 the client receives a message stating that **This license of Rhino is expired**, and offers the choice to **Upgrade this license**, **Enter a new key**, or **Close Rhino**. 

How do we resolve this issue? 

=====Answer=====

This error message is incorrect: The licenses are not expired. Instead, the problem is that the license file in //C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 4.0\System\Rhino.key// is not writable by Rhino.

The fix is easy. 
  - Right-mouse click on the Rhino Desktop icon and select **Run as Administrator**. This will start Rhino with elevated rights so the Rhino.Key file can be created or changed. You will see the same message again. 
  - Click **Enter a new key**, and **OK**. Enter your key code. The data will be saved and Rhino will start. 
  - Then you can start Rhino normally.  
  - Rhino should start successfully as a standard user from then on.

Rhino 5 does not have this problem since it is designed for Win7 and the complications of UAC.\\
