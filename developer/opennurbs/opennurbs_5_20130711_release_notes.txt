====== openNURBS 5 11-July-2013 ======

The latest openNURBS toolkit and example files can be downloaded from [[ http://www.rhino3d.com/opennurbs|http://www.rhino3d.com/opennurbs]].  

===== What's New =====

==== Extrusion Object Render Mesh Support ====

[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5.0/latest|Rhino 5 SR6]] saves extrusion object render meshes in .3dm files.  The 11-July-2013 opennurbs toolkit will read and write these meshes.  For developers using openNURBS to read and display .3dm files in viewer applications, this means you handle extrusion objects (ON_Extrusion) the same way you handle polysurface objects (ON_Brep).

Earlier versions of Rhino simply calculated extrusion object render meshes as needed, did not save them in .3dm files and opennurbs toolkit users had to write their own extrusion object meshing code.
==== Strings and Unicode ====

  * Fixes and enhancements for parsing and converting strings in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8|UTF-8]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16|UTF-16]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-32|UTF-32]] formats.
  * All openNURBS code treats char strings as UTF-8 encoded unicode strings. 
  * All openNURBS code treats wchar_t strings as UTF-X encoded in native CPU byte order, where X = 8*sizeof(wchar_t). (UTF-16 on Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, UTF-32 on Apple OSX).
  * If you encounter [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake|mojibake]] when working with strings in opennurbs, make sure you are using them as UTF-X encoded unicode strings.
==== Example Files Added ====
More example files were added.  In particular, example files containing extrusion objects with render meshes.  The example files can be downloaded from [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/opennurbs/5.0/opennurbs5samples|http://www.rhino3d.com/download/opennurbs/5.0/opennurbs5samples]].

==== Many Bug Fixes ====

===== Why 11-July-2013 was published in October 2013 =====

We delayed the public distribution of the 11-July-2013 openNURBS toolkit was delayed until Rhino 5 SR6 was released in October of 2013.  Rhino 5 SR6 is the first version of Rhino to save extrusion object render meshes.  We felt publishing an openNURBS toolkit with the ability to read information that the shipping version of Rhino 5 could not create or use would have been more frustrating and confusing than helpful.
