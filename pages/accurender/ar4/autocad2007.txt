** Installing AccuRender 4 on [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2007/2008/2009/2010 **

> **Summary:** //The original AccuRender 4 sr0 CD release of AccuRender 4.0 did not support [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2007, 2008, 2009 or 2010.//
  * The patch below is for XP users only.
  * Vista users who have a Ar4 sr0 CD, will need to call 206-545-7000 or email <tech@mcneel.com> for a new CD.

1. First you will need to run [[http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/AR4_2007_CD_Patch.zip|this patch]] before the pre-SR2 CD can be installed.  (This file is a zip file that needs to be unzipped and then installed).

2. Install AccuRender 4 from the product CD that you were shipped.

3. Next you will need the AccuRender 4.0 Service Release 4 to enable [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2008/2009/2010 support.  If you have an early  version of AccuRender (Version 4.0.0 or 4.0.1 when you do the command AR4_ABOUT at the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] command line), download and install the SR4 updater from http://download.mcneel.com/accurender/4.0/sr

Or you can do the command AR4_CHECKFORUPDATES at the [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] command line, which will take you to the download site automatically.

4. Open [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] and type AR4

> **NOTE:** //AccuRender 4.0 SR4 supports Autodesk Architectural 2008/2009/2010, but does not work in Autodesk Mechanical Desktop 2008/2009/2010 "//
