======Zoo - Features Overview======

> **Summary:** //A overview of the features of the Zoo.//

=====Overview=====
The Zoo lets you share Rhino, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, and Bongo licenses (CD-Keys) among users on the same network workgroup. When these products are installed as the workgroup nodes instead of stand-alone, it works like this: 

  * When a workgroup node starts, it requests a license from the Zoo. 
  * An unused license is assigned to the node. 
  * When a node shuts down, the license is returned to the Zoo's license pool. 

** The Zoo is free!**

=====Features=====
  * **No extra costs.** Special versions of Rhino, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, or Bongo are not needed. 
  * **No special hardware needed.** The Zoo will run on any Windows-based system. 
  * **No special software needed.** The Zoo will run on any Windows system that supports Microsoft .Net Framework 4.5, including Windows Vista and newer.
  * **Simple setup.** Install the Zoo on any Windows-based system, and enter the license keys into the Zoo instead of the individual systems. 
  * **Check out.** License keys can be checked out so laptop users can disconnect from the network. The key can be checked in again when the laptop is reconnected to the network. 
  * **Robust.** Network nodes will keep working even if the network connection or server is down.
  * **Routable.** The Zoo works on both single-segments networks, or networks where systems are separated by routers. 
  * **Runs as a service.** If you reboot the system with the Zoo, the Zoo will automatically start up. 

=====More Information=====
  * **Standard Internet Protocol Support.** Clients communicate with Zoo using **HTTP (Port 80)** protocol. This makes it much easier for system administrators to route Zoo requests on complex networks or even over the Internet.
  * **Firewall Friendly.** Zoo requires the client to periodically check with the server, but never initiates connections back to the client. Administrators no longer need to open firewall ports on client machines.
  * **Limited License Check Out.** Prior Zoo version allows for license check out to support laptop users or for business travel. But there was no limit to the check out duration. Zoo allows the administrator to specify the license check out duration.
  * **Third-Party Plug-in Support** Zoo allows 3rd party plug-in developers to add support for their products to the Zoo.
