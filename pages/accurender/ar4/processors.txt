====== Ar4 and Processors. ======

AccuRender 4 will use up to eight processors.

However, its performance doesn't scale very well for more than four processors -- so there tends to be very little difference between four processor machines and eight processor machines, for example.

We would recommend four processors for maximum return on investment.

The beta of AccuRender nXt preforms well on the other hand. It has been shown in preliminary testing to scale very well for 8 processor machines.  It has not been tested on any machines with more than eight processors.  AccuRender nXt is currently limited to 32 processors.
