=====Introduction=====

RhinoScript 101 is a project which aims to ease the transition from user to developer. Scripting is an extremely powerful yet a relatively easy-to-learn way of automating Rhino. However, since it involves programming the mental threshold for beginners is rather high. RhinoScript 101 offers a set of articles about the subject, starting at the beginning.

Initially the RhinoScript 101 Primer was released as a set of articles to be downloaded from this webspace. Due to its size we have merged the project into a single PDF which makes it more maintainable.

This publication is still a work-in-progress. Please send us your comments, questions and wishes.
