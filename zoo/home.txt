======Zoo - License Manager======
[[zoo:home|Zoo Home]]

=====Overview=====
The Zoo lets you share Rhino, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, and Bongo licenses (CD-Keys) among users on the same network workgroup. When these products are installed as the workgroup nodes instead of stand-alone, it works like this: 

  * When a workgroup node starts, it requests a license from the Zoo. 
  * An unused license is assigned to the node. 
  * When a node shuts down, the license is returned to the Zoo's license pool. 

** The Zoo is free!**

**[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/zoo/5.0/latest|Download Zoo 5]]**  for Rhino 5 and Bongo 2.0 (//Brazil 2.0, Flamingo nXt and Penguin 2.0 support requires [[::zoo::rhinolm5|Rhino 5 SR6 or greater]]//).

**[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/zoo/4.0/commercial|Download Zoo 4.0]]** for Rhino 4, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, and Bongo 1.0 (//Rhino 5 and Bongo 2.0 not supported//).

//Note: it is possible to have both Zoo 4.0 and Zoo 5 running on the same network, and even installed on the same server, without conflict.//

<--
-->Simple setup#
Install the Zoo on any system in the workgroup and type the license keys into the Zoo instead of the individual systems. 
<--

=====What's New in Zoo 5?=====
-->New Version!#
Zoo 5 is a brand new version of the Zoo. Completely rewritten, Zoo 5 provides a number of new features not found in prior Zoo versions
<--
-->Standard Internet Protocol Support#
Clients communicate with Zoo 5 using HTTP (Port 80) protocol. This makes it much easier for system administrators to route Zoo requests on complex networks or even over the Internet.
<--
-->Firewall Friendly#
Zoo 5 requires the client to periodically check with the server, but never initiates connections back to the client. Administrators no longer need to open firewall ports on client machines.
<--
-->Limited License Check Out#
Prior Zoo version allows for license check out to support laptop users or for business travel. But there was no limit to the check out duration. Zoo 5 allows the administrator to specify the license check out duration.
<--
-->3rd Party Plug-in Support#
Prior Zoo version only maintained licenses for McNeel product (e.g. Rhino. Flamingo, Bongo, Brazil, and Penguin). Zoo 5 allows 3rd party plug-in developers to add support for their products to the Zoo.
