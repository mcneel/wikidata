====== Running Legacy Rhino On An Older Computer ======

===== Problem:  =====
When you upgrade your legacy Rhino to a current version, the new version may not be support some of your plugins, add-ons, scripts, output devices like laser cutters and more.

For example, users with older lasers that could print to the device directly from **Rhino 5** on Windows 7, found that the same **Rhino 5** on Windows 10 could not do this. 

For **Rhino 7** or later, you will need a new computer that runs Windows 10 or later for optimum performance.  

//While the older **Rhino 4 or 5** software will not run well on your new computer, your newer **Rhino 7** or later software will also not run well on your older computer. This is why you need to keep both computers.//
===== Solution:=====
==== Rhino 5 ====
  - Keep **Rhino 5** on your old computer.  
  - From **Rhino 7**, use the **SaveAs** command to save your files in the // Rhino 5 3DM file// format. //(To access the **SaveAs** command on the Mac, go up to **File** menu and hold down the Options key.)//
  - Copy this file to your legacy computer.
  - Open in **Rhino 5**.


==== Rhino 6 ====
If you require access to your **Rhino 6** after you have upgraded, you will need to licence your **Rhino 6** with the [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/home/cloud-zoo|CloudZoo]] method. You will then be able to continue using **Rhino 6**, even after you have upgrade to a **Rhino 7** or later.

//Note:// You will be allowed to run both on the same computer, 
However, you can not run **Rhino 6** on one computer, while running **Rhino 7** on another.

  - Keep **Rhino 6** installed on your older computer.
  - From **Rhino 7**, use the **SaveAs** command to save your files in the //Rhino 6 3DM file// format. //(To access the SaveAs command on the Mac, go up to File menu and hold down the Options key.)//
  - Copy the 3DM file to your legacy computer, if required.
  - Open 3DM in **Rhino 6**.
