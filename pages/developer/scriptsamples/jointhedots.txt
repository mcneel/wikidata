=====Joining the Dots Script=====
This script joins a series of point objects into a polyline. It is capable of avoiding points that do not belong to the 'apparent' series of points. It can also create self-intersecting polylines.

Points must be fairly evenly spaced (between half and double the distance between the first two points). The current number of points that have been joined is printed in the command line.
