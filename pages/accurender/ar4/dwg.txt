  * For understanding the new AccuRender 4 interface, open and follow the Getting Started PDF (called "User Guide" in later versions of AccuRender 4). You can find it at Start > Programs > AccuRender 4 > EnglishDocumentationAndTutorials > UserGuide, or double-click it in the User Guide\1033 folder in the AccuRender folder. Link here to videos that parallel the "Getting Started PDF."
  * The core renderer and many of the dialog boxes are quite similar to AccuRender 3, so it's worth some dedicated time to master the new icon-based interface. The new features save time in the long run.
