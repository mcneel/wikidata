=====Overview=====


Rhino includes advanced real-time rendering modes. Use these modes to create quick, high quality renderings for design presentation.  For a basic understanding of real-time rendering in Rhino watch this video (3 minutes):

=====Setting up a rendering=====


| [[https://vimeo.com/259726371|{{:rhino:6:rendering:getting-started-realtime.png?direct&300 |Setting up a rendering}}]] | To get started, setting up a rendering is the first step. Here, Kyle covers basic material creation and assignment, the first step in any rendering. \\ (11 minutes) |

=====Additional rendering settings=====

Many settings can be changed to improve the rendering. Take a tour through some of the settings beyond the defaults. 

===Materials and Mapping===

Details on material libraries, making new materials and mapping materials. 

| [[https://vimeo.com/274523131|{{:rhino:6:rendering:rhino6-materials.jpg?direct&300 |Find Materials}}]] | A video on finding the basic material libraries that come with Rhino and how to use them. Vanessa Steeg also looks at the basics of editing materials.\\ (10 minutes) |


| [[https://vimeo.com/268449998|{{:rhino:6:rendering:materials-6-bj.png?direct&300 |Assign Materials}}]] | In this video, learn how to access and use the Rhino 6 for Windows material library. Brian James also explains the details about texture mapping, default settings and mapping customization. \\ (14 minutes) |


===Environment===

If you do not like the reflections or would like to see the model in a different scene, change the environment.

| [[https://vimeo.com/259753617|{{:rhino:6:rendering:environment-v6.png?direct&300 |Change the environment}}]] | Change the reflections and the overall look of the rendering by using one of the many Rhino lighting environments. \\ (2 minutes) |

===Ground plane===

Rhino 6's new ground plane features can create a good base to build your rendering from.

| [[https://vimeo.com/259757117|{{:rhino:6:rendering:groundplane.png?direct&300 |Add a material to the ground plane}}]] | Edit the ground plane in Rhino to improve the foundation of your rendering. \\ (2 minutes)|


===Snapshots===

| [[https://vimeo.com/259775564|{{:rhino:6:rendering:snapshots-v6.png?direct&300 |Use Snapshots to assemble the model}}]] | Snapshots allow multiple views and model configurations to be saved for future reference. Use snapshots to create multiple graphical presentations of the same model. \\ (6 minutes) |

===Saving an image from the display modes===

| [[https://vimeo.com/259732023|{{:rhino:6:rendering:capture-view.png?direct&300 |Capturing on the screen}}]] | Once the display looks good, use Rhino 6's new capture tools to create images for client presentations. \\ (2 minutes)|

=====Decals=====

Decals are textures and images placed on the model in a specific location.  Kyle covers both basic and intermediate ways of using decals on the model.

| [[https://vimeo.com/259779341|{{:rhino:6:rendering:basic-decal-v6.png?direct&300 | Get started using decals in Rhino 6}}]] | Get started using decals to place images and textures in very specific places on the model.  A great way to paint certain parts of a model. \\ (5 minutes) |

| [[https://vimeo.com/259885405|{{:rhino:6:rendering:advanced-decal-v6-png.png?direct&300 | Use the advanced decal engine in Rhino}}]] | Learn how to manage multiple decals on multiple objects in this presentation about Rhino tools.  \\ (7 minutes)  |

=====Raytrace Mode=====

Beyond Rhino render display mode is the new raytrace display mode. This is a new interactive raytrace mode in the viewport.

| [[https://vimeo.com/259905129|{{:rhino:6:rendering:raytrace-mode-v6.png?direct&300 | Use the new advanced raytrace engine in Rhino 6}}]] | Kyle covers the new raytrace display mode and how to get the most out of this new raytrace render mode. \\ (8 minutes) |

| [[https://vimeo.com/259909945|{{:rhino:6:rendering:focal-blur-v6.png?direct&300 | Focal blur in the new advanced raytrace engine in Rhino 6}}]] | Focal blur can be used to add depth and realism to the raytrace view renderings.  Learn how best to use this new feature. \\ (2 minutes) |

| [[https://vimeo.com/259911829|{{:rhino:6:rendering:glass-raytrace-mode.png?direct&300 | Raytrace mode may need a quick edit to the glass}}]] | Raytrace display mode in Rhino may require a change in the glass material.  Here is a quick way to change the glass to look great. \\ (1 minute) |

| [[https://vimeo.com/259917090|{{:rhino:6:rendering:raytrace-display-settings.png?direct&300 | Raytrace mode system settings}}]] | Raytrace display mode also can be configured to take advantage of advanced hardware.  See this video on how to change the raytrace display mode default. \\ (1 minute) |
