=====Question=====
Can I delete older versions in //Add or Remove Programs// without causing problems?

=====Answer=====
The //Add or Remove Programs// entry in the Control Panel in Windows reports all Service Releases as an installed program, each using approximately 250MB of disk space. This is somewhat misleading. Windows reports the total as if all the installed files are added on to the existing installation even though many, if not all, files are actually overwritten on installation. Do **not** use the //Add or Remove Programs// to remove older Service Releases of Rhino 5.
