======Brazil 2.0 y el Zoo======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses how to use Brazil 2.0 with Zoo.//

[[http://brazil.rhino3d.com/|Brazil 2.0]] can be used with either Rhino 4.0 or Rhino 5. Because of this, Brazil 2.0 network licenses can be served by either [[zoo4:home|Zoo 4.0]], Rhino 4.0's network license manager, or [[zoo:home|Zoo 6]], Rhino 5's network license manager.

=====More information=====
Upon initial installation, Brazil 2.0 is configured to use a Zoo 4.0 server for network licensing. 

To reconfigure Brazil 2.0 to use a Zoo 6 server for network licensing, you need to run a utility program.

In Explorer on the Rhino workstation, navigate to the following folder:

====64-bit Windows====
<code>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\McNeel Shared\License Manager
</code>

====32-bit Windows====
<code>
C:\Program Files\Common Files\McNeel Shared\License Manager
</code>

To configure Brazil 2.0 to use a Zoo 6 server, run the **RegRhinoLM5.exe** utility.

To configure Brazil 2.0 to use a Zoo 4.0 server, run the **RegRhinoLM4.exe** utility.

This change needs to be done on each Rhino workstation served by the Zoo.
