Rolland Mellet made an excellent presentation at the Rhino User Meeting Lyon 2009 and showed us how his [[rhino:architecture|architecture]] studio [[http://www.recreation-urbaine.com/|Recreation Urbaine]] designs skate parks and other sports installations.

Manuel Hidalgo lleva más de 50 años entregado a la geometría descriptiva, y se ha dedicado a la docencia en la Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Con más de 20 años de experiencia en CAD y usuario de [[rhino:rhinoceros|Rhino]] desde las primeras versiones, Manuel pone a disposición de los usuarios de Rhino todo el material utilizado en sus clases a estudiantes de Arquitectura. Tanto él como sus alumnos han encontrado en Rhino la herramienta ideal para calcular y representar cualquier forma imaginable con precisión absoluta.

Manuel Hidalgo has more than 50 years experience in descriptive geometry and has been teaching in the Universad Politcnica de Madrid. With more than 20 years' experience in CAD, he has chosen Rhino as the right tool for him and his students to represent any given form with total accuracy. Manuel Hidalgo wants to share with us his extensive manuals, a collection of theory and exercises he has been using in his classes to architectural students:

The [C]Space presentation documents the process of design and production of construction information for a dramatic temporary structure commissioned by the Architectural Association school in London to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the establishment of the AAs Design Research Lab graduate course. The design for the pavilion was selected by an international jury through an anonymous competition open to AADRL graduates.

As an artist I do a lot of unfoldings to realize my work.

Later I cut them with laser (Bystronic-machines) and shape it on a rounding machine.

I work with IronCad and Rhino.

I do my unfoldings with Rhino.

by Yang Liu (Univ. of Hong Kong), Helmut Pottmann (TU Wien), Johannes Wallner (TU Wien), Yong-Liang Yang (Tsinghua Univ., Beijing) and Wenping Wang (Univ. of Hong Kong)

In architectural free-form design, the relationship between shape and fabrication poses new challenges and requires more sophistication from the underlying geometry. The new concept of conical meshes satisfies central requirements for this application: They are quadrilateral meshes with planar faces and are particularly suited to the design of free-form glass structures.

UNStudio is an international architectural practice situated in Amsterdam since 1988 with extensive experience in the fields of urbanism, infrastructure, and public, private, and utility buildings on different scale levels.

Rhino is one of the key software pieces at this studio. One project example is:

**[[http://www.khing.de|Knippers Helbig]]**

Our team designs reliable, efficient, and sophisticated structures in cooperation with clients, architects, and contractors.

Creativity and design competence provide the background of our work and lead to innovative solutions.

Rhino is used in our office generally in two ways. For projects like [[http://www.khing.de/projekte_dacher.php?id=24|FH4]] or [[http://www.khing.de/projekte_dacher.php?id=47|Admirant Eindhoven]] we developed the triangular mesh. Modelling the entire building in projects like [[http://www.khing.de/projekte_brucken.php?id=46|Probst Bridge Stuttgart]] enables us, for example, to generate drawings for the concrete formwork via CAD-software directly from the 3-D model.

Professor Andrew Saunders teaches architectural students at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York. In an advanced-level design studio dealing with differential geometry, they used the Math PlugIn to explore parametric surfaces with [[rhino:rhinoceros|Rhino]].

See the results [[http://www.rhino3.de/album/math/index.shtml|here]].

Zaha Hadid, an Iraqi-born British citizen, has been chosen as the 2004 Laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, marking the first time in its 26-year history that a woman has been named for this award.

Rhino has become one of the key software pieces at this studio. An example is the Mediatheque Intercommunale in Pau, France.

Article by AEC News: "I found myself in the company of old friends - the solid modeling software developers for [[rhino:rhinoceros|Rhinoceros]] known as Robert McNeel Associates. Oddly, the [[rhino:rhinoceros|Rhinoceros]] people were hosting architects during the event, and I couldn't keep my curiosity in check."

=====Titanic's Grand Staircase=====
I have always had great appreciation for Titanic's Grand Staircase and the folks who designed it. Having modeled in once in the past I wanted to remodel it more accurately with Rhino.

Hope you enjoy it.

=====Universal Joint Design Build=====

Universal Joint Design Build is an Austin-based design-build firm focused upon the bridging of [[rhino:architecture|architecture]] and engineering. In many ways we think [[rhino:architecture|architecture]] falls somewhere between sculpture and machine design.

Universal Joint Design Build's blog focuses upon the organization and rationalization of so-called free-form structures.

Current research revolves around a Classical Mathematical Model Collection originally made by hand in plaster in the 1860s.
