Don't know what XAML is?  Neither did I before I started this project.  My guess is that it won't have a huge value to most Rhino users unless you are using Rhino models to develop UI for new apps.  Here's a nice link that will give you an overview of XAML.  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc295302.aspx  If you are running Vista you can view these files in graphically in Internet Explorer (they're ascii so you can view the structure or modify them in Notepad or you favorite text editor).  Iy you are running XP you'll need SilverLight 2 from MS to view it in IE.  Here's a link.  http://www.microsoft.com/SILVERLIGHT/resources/install.aspx?v=2.0
