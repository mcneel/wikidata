{{ :rhino:home:custom8-3.png?200|}}

==== 1. Import RUI Menu Files ====
If you are looking to import an //Rhino 6 or 7 RUI//, you can do that here in Rhino 8:
Go to **Options -> Appearance -> Toolbars** and pick the //Gear// to import a Rhino 7 RUI into Rhino 8

In Rhino 8, you can save and restore unique layouts of toolbars here. 
This is part of the new Rhino 8 Ui system, that is share by both Rhino 8 for Windows and Mac.

**WindowLayout** is also a command that you can type in.

In Rhino 6 or 7, type **OptionsExport** or take it from the Tools menu, and write an the ini file 
In Rhino 8, type **OptionsImport** or take it from the Tools menu, and import the ini file.

==== 4. Toolbar Files from Rhino 5 ====

The Toolbar file .TB can not be imported directly into Rhino 8.
It is an older format the will not be supported.

As a workaround, if you have Rhino 6 or 7 Windows, you can import the Toolbar and save as a RUI.
This is located in Options -> Toolbars -> File.

In  Rhino 8 Windows, go the  Options -> Toolbars -> File, you can open the RUI.
In  Rhino 8 Mac, go the  Rhino 8 -> Settings -> Toolbars -> File, you can open the RUI.

If you do not have Rhino 6 or 7 and you have Rhino 8, you can download a legacy key here and and install Rhino 6 or 7. Download from here.

However, if you have one or two .TB files that you need saved a .RUI files, email //tech@mcneel.com// and attach the files.
We are happy to help.
