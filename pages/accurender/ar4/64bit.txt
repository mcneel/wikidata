====== AR4 and 64 bit Windows ======
AccuRender 4 will not compiled as a 64 bit application.

Therefore AccuRender 4 will not run with [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2008/2009/2010 installed on Windows XP 64, Vista 64 or Windows 7.

  * If you try to load the "ar4_2007loader.arx" file on [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2008, 2009 or 2010 running on XP 64,Vista 64 or Windows 7, you will get the following error: "Unable to load ar4_2007loader.arx."
  * [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] version 2008,2009 and 2010 are installed as a 64 bit applications (which is the default mode of installation) on XP x64 or Vista x64. Installing [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2006 or 2007 on XP x64 should work because these [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] versions did not have a 64 bit mode install option. AccuRender can run in an emulated 32 bit mode with [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2006 and 2007. These older versions of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] were not designed to install on Vista x64.
  * Autodesk may be able to provide instructions on how to do a 32 bit installation of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2008/2009/2010 on the 64 bit operating systems. It may be possible, but we have not found any good instructions as of yet. If you have some, please post them.
  * However AccuRender nXt is supported on [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2008/2009/2010 installed as a 64 bit application on XP x64 or Vista x64. You can join the beta of AccuRender nXt and download a beta of the 64 bit version [[http://nxt.accurender.com/|here]]
