======Zoo Service Shuts Down After Starting======

> **Summary:** //Enabling multiple Zoo server support//

=====Question=====
The Zoo License Manager service seems to stop as soon as it is started. At one time, it was all working fine. I have reinstalled the Zoo software, but it still isn't staying up. The only thing I haven't done is reboot the server and I can't do that during the day. Any thoughts?

=====Answer=====
If you look in the Zoo log file (from the Zoo console, pick **Tools** and then **View Event Log**), you will probably see that another Zoo server is running on your network.

To allow for more than one Zoo service to run on your network, again from 
the Zoo console, select **Tools** and then **Options**. Then check the **Allow multiple Zoo servers to run on this network** option. Then, restart the Zoo service.

=====More information=====
In the past, when only broadcast communications were supported, only one Zoo was allowed to run on a domain or workgroup.  But, now that the Zoo supports routed networks, there may be a situation where you want to run more than one Zoo server. Enabling the **Allow multiple Zoo servers to run on this network** feature lets this happen.

Note, if you enable this feature, you must make sure that your Rhino clients support either DNS or Registry Zoo lookup. 

See the **Installing on Routed Networks** in the Zoo help file for more details.
