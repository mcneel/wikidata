======Running Rhino on Virtual Machines======
Running Rhino on any virtual machine (such as VMWare Fusion, Parallels Desktop, and VirtualBox) is not supported by McNeel. It results in poor graphics quality and slower overall performance compared to running on the same hardware under native Windows.

The performance problems vary with each type of virtual machine. For example, as of this writing, both Parallels and VMWare officially support native accelerated OpenGL calls, but the performance is not very good in either. In fact, when running Rhino, Parallels is faster with OpenGL acceleration disabled in Rhino.  VirtualBox runs well with hardware acceleration disabled. It tends to crash and have strange display problems with complex models and hardware acceleration enabled.
======Running Rhino on Apple computers======
Rhino for Windows will run well on Intel Mac computers: (Sorted by performance, in descending order)
  - Run [[http://mac.rhino3d.com |Rhino 5 for Mac]].    
  - Run Windows using Boot Camp.

Unsupported options:
  * Run Windows in VMWare Fusion.
    * [[http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/|VMWare support]]
  * Run Windows in Parallels. 
    * [[http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop|Parallels support]]
  * Run Windows in VirtualBox. 
    * [[http://www.virtualbox.org/|VirtualBox support]] - [[rhino:virtualmachines:virtualBox|Experience]]

* //**Not supported:** VMWare Fusion, Parallels, and VirtualBox are virtual environments, and will run Rhino about 10 times more slowly than Boot Camp or  Rhino 5 for Mac.//
