And the main error appearing in the installation log file is as follows:

==== Cause of installation failure ====

This issue is caused by your current Windows being unable to properly install //MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstallerX64.exe//. Please open Windows File Explorer, go to //C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft//, and ensure that all files (including protected system hidden files) are visible. Locate and delete the three protected system files: edgecore, edgewebview, and temp. Afterward, restart Windows and reinstall Rhino 8.

==== Forced removal the files ====

Since these three files are part of the Windows system and cannot usually be deleted directly, you will need to use some powerful deletion tools to remove them.
