====== Install Error: "Windows 7/8 is not a supported system" (Rhino 5 for Windows) ======
**Problem:**\\ I'm using Windows 7/8, but Rhino 5 installer says my system is not supported.\\ {{:rhino:rhino5:unsupported_system_en.png?nolink&600|}}

**Cause:**\\ Most likely, a previously attempted Rhino installation was canceled for some reason.\\ Windows **Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA)** appeared.\\ {{http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/rhino/rhino5/pca.png}}\\ You selected **Reinstall using recommended settings**.\\ Windows applied **Windows XP SP2** compatibility mode to the Rhino installer.

**Solution:**\\ 
  - Right-click on the **Rhino installer**, select **Properties**.\\ <color #999999>If your Rhino installer was downloaded from Rhino website, the installer has a name similar to **rh50_xx-xx_5.8.40315.18095.exe**.\\ If you are installing Rhino from a DVD, the installer is the **setup.exe** in the root folder of the DVD. </color>
  - Go to the **Compatibility** tab.\\ <color #999999>The compatibility mode may be set to "Windows XP (Service Pack 2)" and can't be changed.</color>
  - Click the **Change settings for all users** button near the bottom.
  - Clear the **Run this program in compatibility mode** checkbox. 
  - Click **OK** two times to close the dialogs.
  - Right-click on the exe installer again and select **Run as administrator** to install.
