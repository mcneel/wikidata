**Geometría informática arquitectónica**


Manuel Hidalgo lleva más de 50 años entregado a la geometría descriptiva, y se ha dedicado a la docencia en la Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Con más de 20 años de experiencia en CAD y usuario de [[rhino:rhinoceros|Rhino]] desde las primeras versiones, Manuel pone a disposición de los usuarios de Rhino todo el material utilizado en sus clases a estudiantes de Arquitectura. Tanto él como sus alumnos han encontrado en Rhino la herramienta ideal para calcular y representar cualquier forma imaginable con precisión absoluta.

Manuel Hidalgo has more than 50 years experience in descriptive geometry and has been teaching in the Universad Politécnica de Madrid. With more than 20 years experience in CAD, he chose Rhino as the tool for him and his students to represent any given form with total accuracy. Manuel Hidalgo is sharing his extensive manuals, a collection of theories, and exercises he has been using in his architectural classes:

**[C]space  DRL 10 Pavilion, London-UK**

The [C]space presentation documents the design process and production of construction information for a dramatic temporary structure commissioned by the Architectural Association (AA) school in London. Through a competition open to AADRL graduates, an international jury selected the design for the pavilion. The commission celebrates the 10-year anniversary of the establishment of AA's Design Research Lab graduate course.

**[[http://www.geometrie.tuwien.ac.at/wallner/quad06.pdf|Geometric Modeling with Conical Meshes and Developable Surfaces]] (PDF 5,6 MB)**
by Yang Liu (Univ. of Hong Kong), Helmut Pottmann (TU Wien), Johannes Wallner (TU Wien), Yong-Liang Yang (Tsinghua Univ., Beijing) and Wenping Wang (Univ. of Hong Kong)

In architectural free-form design, the relationship between shape and fabrication poses new challenges and requires more sophistication from the underlying geometry. The new concept of conical meshes satisfies central requirements for this application: They are quadrilateral meshes with planar faces and are particularly suited to the design of free-form glass structures.

**[[http://www.unstudio.com|UNStudio]]**

UNStudio is an international architectural practice in Amsterdam since 1988 with extensive experience in urbanism, infrastructure, and buildings on different scale levels (public, private, and utility).

Rhino is one of the key software pieces at this studio. One project example is [[http://www.unstudio.com/projects/mercedes-benz-museum|Mercedes-Benz Museum]], Stuttgart, Germany.

**[[http://www.khing.de|Knippers Helbig]]**

Our team designs reliable, efficient, and sophisticated structures in cooperation with clients, architects, and contractors.

Creativity and design competence provide the background of our work and lead to innovative solutions.

Generally, we use Rhino in our office two ways. For projects like FH4 or Admirant Eindhoven we developed the triangular mesh. Modeling the entire building in projects like Probst Bridge Stuttgart enables us to generate drawings for the concrete formwork via CAD software directly from the 3-D model.

**[[http://www.rhino3.de/album/math/index.shtml|Architecture and the Rhino Math Plug-In]]**

Professor Andrew Saunders teaches architectural students at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York. In an advanced-level design studio dealing with differential geometry, they used the Math PlugIn to explore parametric surfaces with [[rhino:rhinoceros|Rhino]].

See the results [[http://www.rhino3.de/album/math/index.shtml|here]].

Zaha Hadid, an Iraqi-born British citizen, as the 2004 Laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, marks the first time in its 26-year history that a woman has been named for this award.

Rhino has become one of the key software pieces at this studio. An example is the Mediatheque Intercommunale in Pau, France.

Article by AEC News: "I found myself in the company of old friends - the solid modeling software developers for [[rhino:rhinoceros|Rhinoceros]] known as Robert McNeel Associates. Oddly, the Rhinoceros people were hosting architects during the event, and I couldn't keep my curiosity in check."

**Titanic's Grand Staircase**

I have always appreciated Titanic's Grand Staircase and the folks who designed it. Having modeled it once in the past I wanted to remodel it more accurately with Rhino.

Hope you enjoy it.

**Universal Joint Design Build**

Universal Joint Design Build is an Austin-based design-build firm focused upon the bridging of architecture and engineering. In many ways we think architecture falls somewhere between sculpture and machine design.

Universal Joint Design Build's blog focuses upon the organization and rationalization of free-form structures.

Current research revolves around a Classical Mathematical Model Collection originally made by hand in plaster in the 1860s.
