======Rhino OS X======
[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/mac/home|{{ :rhino:mac:osx.png?128|Mac Rhino Wiki Home}}]]


[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/wenatchee/5.0/wip|Download]] the most current work-in-progress (WIP) version. (It is free, for now.)

====Rhino OS X is in development:====

  * **Still missing** are some key features needed for prodcution work are still missing.  This includes:
    * **Grasshopper** - We are not sure how long this will take to develop.
    * Any extra plug-ins - The Developers kit is not finished, so no plugin development can start.
    * Vector Printing - At this point Raster printing is available, but vector printing is not available.
    * Documentation and tutorials. -  Most documentation will be windows specific.  We are working on this.
    * Some surface tools - While these are largely complete, there are still a few commands missing.
    * **Layouts** - Page Layouts are not available at this time. 
  * **Every week or two** a new WIP will be available as new features are added.

-->More details#

Rhino OS X is still in the early development 'Wenatchee' phase. It is **not production-ready**. 

It is **missing** a finished User Interface, Help resources, tutorials, and page layout/printing tools needed for even basic 'in-house' drafting needs. 

Since there is no Software Development Kit (SDK) yet available, third-party plug-in development has not even begun. That includes VRay. 

That said, the surface creation tools are largely complete and useful. If you use it only for surface modeling, then it might work OK for you. However, to get any real work out the door, **you'll need Rhino for Windows** to complete that work.

Support is a little different too. Rhino for Windows is a complete, released, production-ready tool, so our support resources are aimed an you getting your work done.

You are welcome to **participate in the development**, but since Mac Rhino is in development, we are primarily interested in your feedback aimed at finishing the project and getting it released, We aren't focused on you getting production work completed using it.

New builds will come out several times a month during development. Each new build will run for about **60 days** but will be replaced long before it times out.
