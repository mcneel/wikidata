====== Introduzione ai layout di pagina di Rhino 4 ======

The Page (Sheet) Layout is used to arrange, annotate and plot the model. Layout viewports are designed to do the following:

      * Arrange several views of the model at different orientations
      * Assign model scales to the detail viewport.
      * Add annotations like title blocks and general notes
      * Plot from this area 1=1, typically.
Before Page (Sheet) Layouts in Rhino 3, arranging multiple views of the model on a title block was done outside of Rhino with other CAD software.

This tutorial steps you through the setup of a model to plot from a Page (Sheet) Layout viewport. You can download these files and work along with the tutorial. [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/models_layout_exercise2.zip|Files for Page Layout Tutorial]]
