===== Question =====
I was try to add some code for handling the **ON::extrusion_object** type object. But, I don't now know which API I could use to get data from extrusion object. I know there was a new class ON_Extrusion in opennurbs_beam.cpp. But I did not know how to use it. Can you give me some suggestion or some sample code? I would like know how should I import extrusion object?

=====Answer=====
In most cases, you will want to convert the extrusion object to a Brep and then 
just pass the Brep to the Brep handling code that you've already written.

==== Example ====
<code c++>
int i = 0;
for( i = 0; i < model.m_object_table.Count(); i++ )
{
  const ONX_Model_Object& model_object = model.m_object_table[i];
  if( 0 == model_object.m_object )
    continue;

  if( ON::extrusion_object != model_object.m_object->ObjectType() )
    continue;

  const ON_Extrusion* extrusion = ON_Extrusion::Cast( model_object.m_object );
  if( 0 == extrusion )
    continue;

  ON_Brep* brep = ON_Brep::New();
  if( 0 == brep )
    continue;

  if( brep != extrusion->BrepForm(brep, true) )
  {
    delete brep; // don't leak...
    continue;
  }

  // TODO: do something with brep here...

  delete brep; // don't leak...
}
