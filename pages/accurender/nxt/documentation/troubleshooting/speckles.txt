====== Speckle Artifacts ======

Bright spot, or "speckle" artifacts sometime occur during the rendering process.  Two common causes of this artifact, and their solutions, are discussed below.  

If you are using the [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:pathtracer|Path Tracer]] for your renderings then the solutions mentioned in the first suggestion, Blurry Reflection of Light Sources, will not apply.  "Fireflies" are normal during path tracer image generation and will usually resolve over time.  The second suggestion, Solar Highlights, may be helpful in reducing these.

=== Blurry Reflection of Light Sources ===

This problem is usually associated with interior renderings where the light sources are small.  The surfaces exhibiting the artifact typically have blurry reflections. Changing the [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:reflections|Reflection Shader ]]in the material definition using the Advanced Material Editor may help.  In particular, the Glossy, No Light Source Reflections, or Monte Carlo shader can help alleviate this problem.  Each shader will produce a different result.  These shader do not apply to [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:pathtracer|Path Tracer ]]renderings.
 

=== Solar Highlights ===

This problem is typically seen on exterior renderings when the Sun Highlight setting is used.  You can mitigate or eliminate the artifact by setting this to a smaller value on the Lighting->Sun Tab.
