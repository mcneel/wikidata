====== Tangent cylinders ======
> **Summary:** //One of the rules when filleting is the radius used can not run off the edge of the surface it is following.  In the case of tangent cylinders, one surface edge is going to taper down to a zero width at the tangent point.  This tutorial show how to build the fillet surfaces manually.//

Zoom in close to the tips of the arrows at step 3 to see the result. |
