====== Rhino.Inside Revit ======

> **Summary:** Rhino 7 includes a new technology that allows you to work with Rhino & Grasshopper inside Revit's environment. Rhino.Inside Revit allows you to link both platforms and avoid all need to import or export geometry. This creates and unprecedented integration between these applications.

=====Introduction to Rhino.Inside Revit=====

Join McNeel's Scott Davidson in this first introductory video about one of Rhino's 7 new technology: Rhino.Inside Revit. Rhino.Inside is a project that allows you to access Rhino and Grasshopper core functionalities from within another application; in this case, Revit. Learn where to find the information and how to install it. How you every wondered how to get Rhino models into Revit?  (3 minutes):

=====From Rhino into Revit=====

| [[https://youtu.be/dP83XnJS6jQ|{{:rhino:inside:revit:rhino_to_revit_-_thumbnail.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | Watch how to transfer information from Rhino to Revit, creating Revit objects from Rhino geometry. See how editing objects in Rhino affects its counterparts in Revit, through this live link without any need to import or export!

=====From Revit into Rhino=====

| [[https://youtu.be/8AjX3YlwjEs|{{:rhino:inside:revit:revit_to_rhino_-_thumbnail.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | In this video, you will learn how to transfer geometry from Revit into Rhino. This is a common workflow used for manufacturing purposes or for 3D printing the model.

=====Using Grasshopper Parameters in Revit=====

| [[https://youtu.be/yDZ4y-ZbBkM|{{:rhino:inside:revit:parameters_in_revit_-_thumbnail.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | In this video, Scott Davidson will show how to use parameters in Revit through Rhino's generative design plugin, Grasshopper. You'll also learn how to use Human UI, a Grasshopper plugin, to create your own dialog boxes that can interact with Revit.

=====Interacting with Revit objects=====

| [[https://youtu.be/mYSSoOD3QVM|{{:rhino:inside:revit:interact_with_revit_objects_-_thumbnail.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | Learn how to reference Revit elements using Grasshopper parameters and output Revit objects. You can edit these objects in Revit and have the Grasshopper freeform geometry update accordingly.
