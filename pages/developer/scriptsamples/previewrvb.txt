=====Question=====
I want to preview RhinoScript .rvb files, and perhaps other text files, by clicking on the Preview Pane button in Windows Explorer with Windows 7. Any ideas on how I can accomplish this?

=====Answer=====
You have to add entries into the Windows Registry to get this to work on Windows 7.

  * Open the Windows Registry Editor, or REGEDIT.EXE.
  * Navigate to //HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.FILE_EXT//, where .FILE_EXT is the extension you want to add, such as .rvb.
  * Make two new string values, REG_SZ, under the file extension's key: **Content Type**, and **PerceivedType**.
  * Set the value of **Content Type** to **text/plain** and **PerceivedType** to **text**.
