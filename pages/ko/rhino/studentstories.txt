[[rhino:rhinoceros|RhinoCeros]] 3.0 is a key tool in the Queen’s Solar Vehicle Team project.  This excellent CAD program is incredibly effective in all aspects of solar car design.  The powerful [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] modeling system accurately describes the complex free-form curves we work with to optimize aerodynamic performance, and can effectively integrate components drawn in many other programs to build a single model- allowing us to find and fix clearance, tolerance and ergonomic problems before any money or material is committed.

The QSVT chooses Rhino not only for its effective rendering and visualization ability, but for its compatibility as well. Rhino can export and import more than a dozen different formats, from raw triangles to IGES to STEP and others.  Airfoil profiles in [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] formats, mechanical assemblies drawn in [[rhino:solidedge|SolidEdge]] and many other components are easily integrated into the car model.  And if our Fluent CFD analysis illuminates a specific problem with the airflow, we can modify that part of our design quickly and effectively using Rhino’s intuitive control point interface. Importing airfoil curves is easy; Rhino allows us to generate curves and surfaces from point clouds, meshes, [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] files, and just about anything else we can come up with.

New team members routinely applaud Rhino’s numerous tutorials and the helpful workbook. As they quickly pick up the software, the Command Line interface becomes their new best friend, allowing for even faster and more effective control of the design.  Even experienced managers quickly come to prefer Rhino over programs that retail for ten times as much.  With a bit of practice we can sketch in 3D, to ten microns of precision, faster than we can put rough 2D sketches on paper.

We also make good use of the multiple monitor and multiple process support in Rhino. When dealing with the full model of a solar car, which might include separate blocks for the aeroshell, chassis, wheels, suspension, hatches, and driver mesh, the ability to spread the layout over several monitors and several files is an invaluable tool.  With block entities cross-linked between files, we can work with dozens of components at once, updating links in real time, even on older Pentium III machines.
