======Rhino 6 License Options======

> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Learn what options exist to license Rhino. Find the best license type to fit your situation.//

While the Rhino End User License Agreement has not changed, we have changed how it is enforced so Rhino V6 licensingÂ options have changed.

There are now three ways to use your license:
  - Stand-alone on a single computer
  - Floating on a company network using the Zoo [legacy]
  - Rhino Accounts [New] Add your license to your account and it will float to any computer you have access to using the Internet instead of a local area network
  - Create Teams, add multiple licenses, and invite users to join the Team to share the licenses over the Internet

We recommend using Rhino Accounts for maximum flexibility. Details: https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino_accounts/home

You can change from one licensing type to another but it is not automatic.
