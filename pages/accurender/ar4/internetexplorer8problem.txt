====== Error message “This file must be present to allow the IExtractIcon interface to work” in the Content Browser. ======



=====Problem:=====
When you open up the AccuRender 4 Content Browser you do not see any library folder you only get the error message **“This file must be present to allow the IExtractIcon interface to work”**

The problem is caused by installing Internet Explorer 8, which breaks the Content Browser. The Content Browser in AccuRender 4 is 100% repling on the IE7. Microsoft changed the underlying technology of the browser application between IE7 and IE8 causing IE8 to be incompatible with AccuRender 4.

=====Solution:=====

Unfortunately is no fix for this. The problem only occurs with the AccuRender Content Browser. 

You can still apply materials or insert plants:
  * By using the Material and Plant Docking Windows.
  * If you prefer to drag and drop Materials you can have an Windows Explorer window open with the Materials and just drag and drop them in to AccuRender from there. 
  * In addition, you can type Ar3 and use the Ar3 interface. This is embedded in Ar4 as a backup tool.
  
Here is a link to the offical [[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/957700
|Microsoft instructions]] for unistalling Internet Explorer 8.

In general, with Microsoft XP and Vista, uninstalling Internet Explorer 8 will roll you back to 7.
However, IE8 is embedded in Windows 7 with no options to roll back to IE7.
