=====Description=====
This Labs plug-in will allow you to open or import .E57 files. The E57 file format is a compact, vendor-neutral format for storing point clouds, images, and metadata produced by 3D imaging systems, such as laser scanners. The file format is specified by the ASTM, an international standards organization, and it is documented in the ASTM E2807 standard.
