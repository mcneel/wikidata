====== I/O Error During Installation of AccuRender 4.0 ======

======AccuRender 4.0 Installation Terminates with I/O Error======
Partway through the installation of AccuRender 4.0 from the product CD, an I/O error occurs and the installation is terminated before completion.

=====Solution=====
  * 1. Copy the file //Setup_AccuRender.exe// (very large, over 460MB) from the AccuRender folder on the CD to your local hard disk (such as to your Desktop), or to a shared drive on your network.
  * 2. Then launch AccuRender installation from the copied file on your work station or network drive. The installation should complete successfully.
  * 3. When the AccuRender install is done, delete the copied //Setup_AccuRender.exe// file. It is not needed for AccuRender to run.
