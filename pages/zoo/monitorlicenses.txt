=====Question=====
Is there a way to actively monitor license usage in real time from a device other than the server? We would like the ability to allow users to see who is currently using a license in order to allow self-regulation of our licenses. Many of our other applications expose a webpage or provide a separate viewer application that can display the current usage.

=====Answer=====
Zoo 5 Service Release 8 (SR8) or newer allows users to monitor license usage from the convenience of their web browser. Just visit the **status** page provide by your Zoo server by entering:

  http://<zoo_server_host_name>/status

into your favorite web browser. For example, if your Zoo server's host name is "zooserver.mycorp.com", then you'd enter:

  http://zooserver.mycorp.com/status
  
To determine the version of the Zoo you are running, launch the **Zoo Administrator** (ZooAdmin.exe) and select **Help -> About**.
