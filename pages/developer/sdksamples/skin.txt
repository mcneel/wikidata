====== Create a Skin using the Rhino C++ SDK ======
> **Developer:** //[[developer:cplusplusplugins|C++]]//
> **Summary:** //The Rhino Application Platform (RAP) provides the tools for C++ developers to wrap their application around Rhino by creating a custom Skin.//

=====Overview=====
Rhino lets developers customize most of Rhino's interface so that the application appears to be their own. We call this a custom //Skin//. With a custom Skin, you can change the application icon, splash screen, the menu bar, the application title bar, the about box, and the toolbars.

Creating a custom Skin for Rhino involves creating two code modules:

  * **<skin name>.rhs** is a regular MFC DLL that implements the Skin's icon, splash screen, and, optionally, a menu. In this article, we will refer to this as the Skin DLL.
  * **<skin name>.rhp** is a Rhino utility plug-in that implements the menu handler, if necessary, and one or more custom commands. In this article, we will refer to this as the Skin Plug-in.

=====Create the Skin DLL=====
  * A Skin DLL is a regular MFC DLL that implements the Skin's icon, splash screen, and, optionally, a menu.
  * To create the Skin DLL, launch Visual Studio and run the //Rhino Skin DLL// wizard installed by the Rhino SDK.
  * The Rhino Skin DLL wizard creates three classes:
    - A CWinApp-derived class. This is the entry point of the DLL.
    - A CRhinoSkinDLL-derived class. This class lets you specify Rhino's icon, splash screen, and menu. For more information on this class, see rhinoSdkSkinDLL.h.
    - CSplashWnd. This is a basic implementation of a splash screen class. If you need something fancier, feel free to replace it with your own implementation.
  * Modify the project's icon and splash screen bitmap. If your Skin is going to override Rhino's main menu, then you will need to create your menu resources as well.
  * Remember to fill out the developer information block found at the top of your DLL's .CPP file. This block is similar to that of Rhino plug-ins.

=====Create the Skin Plug-in=====
  * A Skin Plug-in is a Rhino utility plug-in that implements the menu handler, if necessary, and one or more custom commands.
  * To create a Rhino utility plug-in, launch Visual Studio and run the //Rhino Plug-in// wizard installed by the Rhino SDK. When picking the wizard to run, make sure to add the new project to the open solution instead of creating a new solution. This way, your Skin project is organized into a single solution.
  * If the Skin DLL provides a custom menu, then copy the UUID generated by the plug-in AppWizard and found in your plug-in's CRhinoPlugIn::PlugInID() member to your Skin's CRhinoSkinDLL::SkinPlugInID() member.
  * **Important!** These two methods must return the same UUID. This is a critical step as it identifies the main plug-in that Rhino will load to manage its menus and extend the Rhino command set.
  * Add the following overrides to the header file of your CRhinoPlugIn-derived class:

<code c++>
// Skin DLL menu update handler
void OnInitPlugInMenuPopups(WPARAM wparam, LPARAM lparam);

// Skin DLL menu command handler
BOOL OnPlugInMenuCommand(WPARAM wparam );

// Change to CRhinoPlugIn::load_plugin_at_startup
plugin_load_time PlugInLoadTime();
</code>

  * Add the following definition to the .CPP file of your CRhinoPlugIn-derived class.

<code c++>
CRhinoPlugIn::plugin_load_time CSkinPlugInSamplePlugIn::PlugInLoadTime()
{
  // Override to change load time to "at startup"
  return CRhinoPlugIn::load_plugin_at_startup;
}
</code>

  * If your Skin DLL is providing a custom menu, then add a source file named MenuHandler.cpp to the plug-in project and put the definition of CRhinoPlugIn::OnInitPlugInMenuPopups() and CRhinoPlugIn::OnPlugInMenuCommand() in this file. 
  * **Important!** Include the Skin DLL's Resource.h file in MenuHandler.cpp to provide access to the Skin DLL's menu resource identifiers. For example:

<code c++>
#include "stdafx.h"
#include "MySkinPlugIn.h"
#include "../MySkinDLL/Resource.h"

// Put these to overrides in a separate CPP file so they could
// include the MySkinDLL/Resource.h file without conflicting
// with this projects resource.h

void CSkinPlugInSamplePlugIn::OnInitPlugInMenuPopups(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
  HMENU hMenu = (HMENU)wParam;
  if( NULL == hMenu )
    return;

  switch( GetMenuItemID(hMenu, LOWORD(lParam)) )
  {
    case IDM_SAMPLE_DISABLE:
      ::EnableMenuItem( hMenu, IDM_SAMPLE_DISABLE, MF_BYCOMMAND|MF_DISABLED|MF_GRAYED );
      break;
    case IDM_SAMPLE_SUB_DISABLE:
      ::EnableMenuItem( hMenu, IDM_SAMPLE_SUB_DISABLE, MF_BYCOMMAND|MF_DISABLED|MF_GRAYED );
      break;
    // TODO...
  }
}

BOOL CSkinPlugInSamplePlugIn::OnPlugInMenuCommand(WPARAM wParam)
{
  ON_wString w;
  switch( (UINT)wParam )
  {
    case IDM_SAMPLE_ONE:
      w = L"Test Item One";
      break;
    case IDM_SAMPLE_TWO:
      w = L"Two";
      break;
    case IDM_SAMPLE_DISABLE:
      w = L"Disabled";
      break;
    case IDM_SAMPLE_SUB_A:
      w = L"Sub Menu A";
      break;
    case IDM_SAMPLE_SUB_B:
      w = L"Sub Menu B";
      break;
    case IDM_SAMPLE_SUB_DISABLE:
      w = L"Sub Menu Disabled";
      break;
    default:
      return true;
  }

  ::RhinoMessageBox( w, L"OnMenu", MB_OK );
  return true;
}
</code>

=====Finishing up=====
  * Compile the Skin Plug-in.
  * Load the Skin Plug-in using Rhino's PluginManager command so it has a chance to self-register.
  * Compile the Skin DLL.

=====Installation=====
To install your custom Skin, use **REGEDIT.EXE** to add a scheme key to your registry with a path to your Skin DLL. For example:

|**Item**|**Value**|
|Subkey|HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\McNeel\Rhinoceros\4.0\Scheme: MySkin|
|Entry name|SkinDLLPath|
|Type|REG_SZ|
|Data value|C:\Src\MySkin\MySkinDLL\Release\MySkinDLL.rhs|

You can now test your custom Skin by creating shortcut to your Rhino executable with /scheme="<scheme name from the previous step>" as command line argument. For example:

<code>
"C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 4.0\System\Rhino4.exe" /scheme=MySkin
</code>



=====Additional information=====
If the user chooses not to run your skinned version of Rhino, you might want to prevent your Skin plug-in loading. You can do this by checking to see if the name of the scheme that Rhino is using matches your Skin's scheme name. Do this by checking in your plug-in's CRhinoPlugIn::OnLoadPlugIn() member.

For example:

<code c++>
BOOL CSkinPlugInSamplePlugIn::OnLoadPlugIn()
{
  ON_wString scheme = RhinoApp().RegistrySchemeName();
  if( scheme.CompareNoCase(L"Scheme: MySkin") != 0 )
    return -1; // Fail silently...
    
  // TODO...
      
  return CRhinoUtilityPlugIn::OnLoadPlugIn();
}
</code>
