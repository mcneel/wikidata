====== AccuRender 4 User Manual ======

> **Summary:** //The AccuRender 4 User Manual is now incorporated into the Help and the PDF manual.//

  * The detailed explanations you would expect in a User's Manual have been incorporated into the much-expanded Help in AccuRender 4.  Access the Help directly from the AccuRender pull-down menu's red question mark, or the AccuRender toolbar's red question mark, or by pushing F1 when you have an AccuRender dialog box open.
