====== RhinoScript ======
> **Summary:** //Illustrates [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] code that determines the physical, or MAC, address of a computer.//

The following [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] uses the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to determine the physical addresses, or MAC addresses, of a computer.


<code vb>
 Sub PrintMacAddress

   Dim strComputer
   strComputer = "."

   Dim objWMIService
   Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:" _
       & "{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\" & strComputer & "\root\cimv2")

   Dim colAdaptors
   Set colAdapters = objWMIService.ExecQuery _
       ("SELECT * FROM Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration WHERE IPEnabled = True")

   Dim n
   n = 1

   For Each objAdapter In colAdapters
    Rhino.Print 
    Rhino.Print "Network Adapter " & n
    Rhino.Print "  Description: " & objAdapter.Description
    Rhino.Print "  Physical (MAC) address: " & objAdapter.MACAddress
    n = n + 1
   Next

 End Sub
