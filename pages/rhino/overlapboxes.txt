\\

\\

| {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/How_to_tutorials/Fillets/OverlapBoxes/OverlapBoxes3.png}} | Extract the four fillet surfaces from one corner and untrim one crossing pair. |

\\

| {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/How_to_tutorials/Fillets/OverlapBoxes/OverlapBoxes4.png}} | Use FilletSrf with a radius of 0.25, to create a fillet between the untrimmed pair. |

\\
