===== Question =====
As described on your [[:zoo:zooosx|website]], we installed the Zoo on VMWare Fusion Pro and Windows on our Mac OS X server. For whatever reason, it just does not work. From Rhino, we have tried both the automatic detection and specifying the servers IP address. Rhino just reports, //An unknown exception has occurred. Please contact your system administrator for assistance.//

===== Answer =====
Keep in mind that you're not just running Windows, you're running Windows as a virtual machine under OS X. So there will be additional network configuration required to make all this work.

If you are not familiar VMWare and networking, this is worth reviewing:

You can also find more helpful information by searching the web for "Run Web Server on VMWare Fusion", keeping in mind that the Zoo uses TCP Port 80 just like a web server.

Depending on what your Mac server is doing and how many other VMWare sessions it supports, configuration might be very simple or a little more involved.

For example, if your Mac server does not host any web services and only runs a single VMWare session, then all you need to do is configure the session's network adapter for "Bridged" mode. This is the simplest way to get the Zoo to work on VMWare. 

If you need the network adapter configured for NAT, then you will need to configure VMWare for port forwarding.
