====== Advanced Flattening ======
> **Summary:** Since the Expander plug-in from Ship Constructor will not be available for Rhino 4.0, we have started developing a replacement. //<color red>This is the first prototype.</color>//


  * Download and install:
    * [[#Installation|For Rhino 4.0]].
    * For Rhino 5: Advanced Flattening is included in Rhino 5. //[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5/latest?PageSpeed=noscript|Download Rhino 5 now...]]//
 

=====Background=====

Rhino 4.0 has:

  * **UnRollSrf** - makes a flat pattern from 3D developable (curved in one direction) surfaces. //<color red>Always use this command first. If it fails, then try Squish.</color>//
  * **Smash** - is a special version of **UnRollSrf** that does not check to see if the surface is developable. It is not recommended now that **Squish** is available.
  * **Squish** //<color red>new</color>// - makes a flat pattern from a 3D non-developable (curved in two directions) surface or polygon mesh.  In general, try **UnRollSrf** first.

Rhino 4.0 does **not** have:

  * **Unfold or unbend** - to make a flat pattern from 3D shapes made from bending up a 2D pattern. Mostly used to create sheet metal cases, etc. Most MCAD products do this nicely, ojezu.
  * **Flow** - to make a flat pattern for a 3D shape made by flowing metal over a complex mold. An example is stamping a soda can from the metal disk or stamping an auto interior door panel from a flat pattern.
  * **Peel** - to split surfaces based on where they might rip and flattens the surfaces. An example is flattening a sphere. //Note: if the shape is already split, Squish may work. You can tell when and where a 3D surface needs to be split by where it has extreme stretching or compression or the 2D pattern overlaps.//

=====Squish overview=====

The **Squish** command flattens a non-developable (curved in two directions) 3-D mesh or [[rhino:nurbs|NURBS]] surface into a flat 2D pattern.

{{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/squish2.jpg}}
{{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/squish3.jpg}}

The **Squish** command marks areas of compression (red point cloud) and stretching (green point cloud) and displays statistics about the amount of compression or stretch.

  Area: unchanged
  Compression: average=0.04%, maximum=0.11% (in 44% of the surface)
  Stretching:  average=0.07%, maximum=0.28% (in 35% of the surface)

Here //compression// means the material will be compressed when the 2D pattern is deformed into the 3D shape. //Stretching// means the material will be stretched when the 2D pattern is deformed into the 3D shape.  The percentages in the parenthesis give you an estimate of how much of the pattern will be compressed or stretched.

Up to ten text dots mark the locations with the most dramatic deformation. The number in the text dot is the percent stretching change in length. In the image above, the green text dots displaying "0.3" mean the regions near those dots will be stretched by 0.3% (3/1000) when mapped to 3D.

=====SquishBack overview=====

The **SquishBack** command lets you place points and curves on a 2D pattern that was made with the Squish command, and then "unsquish" them back to the 3D shape.

For example, suppose we wanted to put a "Rhino" brand name in the black circle on this 3D [[rhino:nurbs|NURBS]] model of a shoe last.

First use the **Squish** command to generate a 2D pattern of the last.

{{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/SquishBack_2dShapeBefore.jpg}}

Then use the **TextObject** command to create the white "Rhino" text as curves on the 2D pattern.

Finally, use the **SquishBack** command to "unsquish" the white Rhino text onto the 3D last.

=====Squish command options=====

  * SplitSeams=Yes/No
    * Use SplitSeams=Yes for meshes from a single surface.
    * Use SplitSeams=No for meshes from a polysurface.
  * StiffBoundary=No/Yes
    * If StiffBoundary=Yes, Squish makes an extra effort to avoid distorting boundary lengths.
  * Deformation=Free/StretchMostly/StretchOnly/CompressMostly/CompressOnly
    * There are five built-in deformation options to choose from depending on your bias for stretching or compressing, and the ability to specify custom deformation settings.
      * Free - No preference for compression or stretching.
      * StretchMostly - Strong bias for expansion when the pattern is deformed into the 2D shape.
      * StretchOnly - Absolutely no compression when the pattern is deformed into the 2D shape.
      * CompressMostly - Strong bias for compression when the pattern is deformed into the 2D shape.
      * CompressOnly - Absolutely no expansion when the pattern is deformed into the 2D shape.
      * CustomA, CustomB, CustomC - custom deformations.
      * [[#CustomSetup]] - Used to specify settings used by the CustomA, CustomB and CustomC options.
  * Material=Rigid/Floppy
    * If you are manufacturing something out of a rigid material and want to minimize stresses when forming the 3D surface from the 2D pattern, use **Rigid**.
    * If you are manufacturing something out of a floppy material and you want to limit geometric distortion as much as possible, use **Floppy**.
    * If you are manufacturing using a rigid material that is inelastically deformed, let us know what settings work best.
    * We can add support for more materials as we learn more about your needs.
  * Decorate=Yes/No
    * The red and green point clouds and text dots are decorations.  To turn them off, set Decorate=No.
  * Outside=Up/Down
    * If Outside=Up, the //outside// of the 3D surface is //up// in the 2D pattern.
    * If Outside=Down, the //outside// of the 3D surface is //down// in the 2D pattern.

=====Using CustomSetup to define custom deformations=====

The CustomSetup option lets you set the parameters used by the custom deformations.  There are four parameters you can set.

  * BndStretch
  * BndCompress
  * InteriorStretch
  * InteriorCompress
The default value for these parameters is 1 and they can be set to any positive number.  A larger value reduces the amount of the specified deformation compared to what happens when all four parameters are equal.  For example, if you want to severely limit interior expansion, you could do something like:

   BndStretch=1
   BndCompress=1
   InteriorStretch=1
   InteriorCompress=100

If you want to preserve boundary lengths you could use the settings:

   BndStretch=10
   BndCompress=10
   InteriorStretch=1
   InteriorCompress=1

=====Limitations=====

  * Does **not** unroll, unfold, or peel.
  * Does not work great on developable surfaces. Use the UnRollSrf command.
  * For stamping with extreme deformations, like stamping aluminum beverage cans from aluminum disks, Squish will be worse than useless.
  * No check for overlapping 2D results.


=====To do=====

  * Label lines and surfaces.
  * Polysurface/solids support.
  * Simultaneous "Squishing" of multiple surfaces, and attempt to layout the resulting patterns in the best possible way. (Olivier Suire)
  * Better annotate on the plate the expansion/contraction. This is nicely represented by the graphical 'heat chart' with colors showing the relative change. This does not travel well when you go into the shop. It is my opinion that there should be contour rings printed on the plate at steps appropriate to the plate expansion/contraction much like a topographical map. This way the guy on the Eckhold machine would be able to concentrate on specific areas and know which direction to work. //-- Paul Fuchs//
  * Fancy dialog interface.
  * Button development, first attempt (Gerard Petersen) {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/Button_24x24.jpg}}

=====Feedback=====

Please post feedback to Dale Lear on the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/|Rhino User Forum]], be sure to use the word "Squish" in the subject line of your post.

We need to know whether or not the flattened patterns generated by the **Squish** command are useful in your specific manufacturing application.  If you have a 3D model and 2D patterns that were used to successfully manufacture the object, we would like to compare the pattern created by the **Squish** command with the pattern that was used in manufacturing.  Even if you cannot share the model, please let us know what is important in your specific manufacturing application.

    * What materials are you using?
    * How important is preserving area?
    * How much compressing can be tolerated?
    * How much expansion can be tolerated?
    * How much shear can be tolerated?
    * How important is preserving boundary length?
    * Does the material behave differently near the edge?
