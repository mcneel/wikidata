====== Resolving "Unable to communicate with license manager" Errors ======
**1) Did you just remove the Rhino 5 Beta?**

Please download and install [[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26347|Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update]]. After installation, Rhino 4 should be able to communicate with the license manager properly.

//**2) Are you running Rhino 5 and did you just uninstall Rhino 4?**//

  * Flamingo nXt, Bongo 1.0/2.0, and Rhino 4 use a common file called RhinoLM.
  * When Rhino 4 is uninstalled, the RhinoLM is removed and this leaves Flamingo nXt, Bongo 1.0/2.0 unable to run in both 32-bit and 64-bit Rhino 5.

//To reinstall the McNeelLM without reinstalling Rhino 4//, download, unzip, and run **rhinolm_20110309_x86.exe** which is in this [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/mcneel/flamingo/nxt/rhinolm_20110309.zip|rhinolm_20110309.zip file.]]

  * You must have rights to modify the registry to run rhinolm_20110309_x86.exe. If access is denied, find a computer adminstrator to log in with elevated rights account, and run **rhinolm_20110309_x86.exe**. Windows Vista users: right-click on the file and select “Run as administrator”. 


**3) Running Windows Vista or Windows 7?**

Make sure you're running Rhino 4.0 SR9:
  - Start Rhino 4
  - From the Help menu, click Check for Updates

**4) Reinstall Rhino 4**

Unfortunately, something is wrong with your Rhino 4 installation. Follow these steps to repair your installation:
  - Uninstall Rhino 4 - you may need to remove multiple "Rhinoceros 4.0 SRx" items.
  - Delete the "License Manager" folder under 
    * C:\Program Files\Common Files\McNeel Shared\ (For a 32-bit system)
    * C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\McNeel Shared\ (For a 64-bit system)
  - Install Rhino 4 again
  - Start Rhino 4
  - From the Help menu, click Check for Updates
  - Download and install the latest service release if required

**4) Still not working?**

If none of these work, see the [[rhino:licensemanagererrors:advanced|Advanced Troubleshooting for License Manager Errors]] page.
