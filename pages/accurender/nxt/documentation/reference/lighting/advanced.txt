====== The Advanced Lighting Tab ======

The Advanced Lighting tab provides more detailed options for controlling lights. Its controls are:

  * **Sky.** This defines a hemispherical light source, infinitely far away from your model. There are four options for Sky lighting: Off, Auto, [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:hdri|HDRi]], and Color and Image. The automatic Sky provides an analytical model based on real-world sky conditions. To adjust parameters for automatic Sky use the Sun tab.
  * **Sun.** The Sun is a directional light source infinitely far away from the model. The Sun control allows the Sun to be turned on and off.
  * **Studio Brightness.** Studio Brightness reduces the brightness of the Sun and Sky by a factor of 20, mimicking the interior lighting levels of a photographer's studio.
  * **Lights.** This enables and disables artificial lighting.
  * **Indirect.** This is the lighting reflected off of surfaces. By default, it is on for interior lighting presets and off for exteriors and studio models. It is also possible to [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:indirect_exterior|turn on indirect lighting for exterior renderings.]]
  * **Indirect Bounces.** This controls the number of reflections caused by an indirect light, ranging from one to four.
  * **Color Bleed.** Color Bleed controls the amount of color transfer associated with each indirect bounce. It varies from zero to one.
  * **Ambient.** 
  * **Automatic Daylight Portals.** A daylight portal is an opening for Sun and Sky lighting for an interior rendering. Automatic Daylight Portals sets all transparent materials as daylight portals.
  * **Monte Carlo Reflections.** This checkbox is intended to resolve blurry reflections containing small, bright areas. This comes at a performance cost. The standard reflection algorithm almost always converges faster, even with blurry reflections.
  * **Reflective Bounces.**
  * **Refractive Bounces.**
  * **Lights Per Pass.** A specified number of lights are rendered each pass. Increasing the Lights Per Pass increases the information contained in each pass, but requires more time per pass.
  * **Channels.** This controls the number of channels for [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:multi-channel|multi-channel rendering.]]
