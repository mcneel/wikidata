=====Discussion=====
A periodic knot vector can be either uniform or non-uniform.

A periodic degree d NURBs curve has (d-1) continuous derivatives at the start/end point.

The differences between successive knot values are equal near the start and end of the spline; that is, the differences repeat themselves and hence the term //periodic//.

Specifically, when -degree < i < degree, a periodic knot vector satisfies

   k[(degree-1)+i+1] - k[(degree-1)+i] = k[(cv_count-1)+i+1] - k[(cv_count)+i]

For example a cubic periodic knot vector looks like

   {a,b,c,d,e, ...,  p+a,p+b,p+c,p+d,p+e}

with a < b < c < d < e and e < p+a.

Chapter 12 of The [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] Book has a few pages discussing periodic NURBs (look in the index), but the discussion is limited.  Chapter 14 of [[http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Splines-Applied-Mathematical-Sciences/dp/0387953663|Carl de Boor's Practical Guide to Splines]] provides a few more details.
