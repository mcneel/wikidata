=====Question=====
I have a closed spline that is intersected by a circle. I want to open the closed spline by trimming out the section crossed by the circle. I am trying to use RhinoScript's **TrimCurve** method, but I am not having much success. Any help would be appreciated.

=====Answer=====
With **TrimCurve**, if the input curve is closed, then the trimming interval should be decreasing.

For example:

<code vb>
 Option Explicit

 Sub CircleTrimmer

   ' Local variable declarations
   Dim curve, circle, ccx, ccx_t(1), interval

   ' Select closed curve to split
   curve = Rhino.GetObject("Select closed curve to split", 4)
   If IsNull(curve) Then Exit Sub
   If Not Rhino.IsCurveClosed(curve) Then Exit Sub

   ' Select circle to split with    
   circle = Rhino.GetObject("Select circle to split with", 4)
   If IsNull(circle) Then Exit Sub
   If Not Rhino.IsCircle(circle) Then Exit Sub

   ' Intersect the two curves
   ccx = Rhino.CurveCurveIntersection(curve, circle)
   If IsNull(ccx) Then
     Rhino.Print "Curve and circle do not intersect"
     Exit Sub
   End If

   ' Make sure there are only two intersection events
   If UBound(ccx) <> 1 Then
     Rhino.Print "Unable to split curve"
     Exit Sub
   End If

   ' Get two intersection parameters on the curve
   ccx_t(0) = ccx(0,5)
   ccx_t(1) = ccx(1,5)

   ' If the input curve is closed and the interval is decreasing,
   ' then the portion of the curve across the start and end of the
   ' curve is returned.
   If ccx_t(0) < ccx_t(1) Then
     interval = Array(ccx_t(1), ccx_t(0))
   Else
     interval = Array(ccx_t(0), ccx_t(1))
   End If

   ' Trim the curve
   Rhino.TrimCurve curve, interval

 End Sub
