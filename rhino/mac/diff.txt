====== Differences between Windows Rhino and Mac Rhino ======
=== Mac-only user interface additions ===

A number of commands and features that are available only on the Mac version.  See [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/mac/userinterfacefeatures|this wiki page]] for details. 

-->Mouse#

**Recommendations**

  * For easy right-mouse navigation, a two‑button mouse with a scroll wheel is recommended, but all operations are possible using a one-button mouse.
  * To duplicate right-mouse actions with a one-button mouse, hold down the **Control** key and click the mouse button.\\ \\

**Navigation**

  * **Right-mouse button drag** and **Shift+right-mouse button drag** operations are the same as Windows. See [[http://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/5/help/en-us/user_interface/shortcuts.htm|Rhino Help - Shortcuts]]. \\ Regardless of the view projection style, hold down the **Shift** key to always pan, hold down the **Command** key to always zoom, and hold down the **Command+Shift** keys to always rotate the view.
  * Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out in a view.
  * If you have a one-button mouse, you hold down the **Control**, **Command**, and **Shift** keys together to always rotate a view.

-->Right-click context menu#

  * Right-click in a viewport displays a context menu.
  * By default right-click does **not** act as **Enter** to repeat the last command. \\ To change this, in **Rhinoceros** > **Preferences** > **Mouse** > **Mouse**, turn off **Enable context menus**.

-->Command line#

To activate the command line, just start typing. A **Command Search** window appears.

-->Toolbars and tool palettes#

  * Mac Rhino has //tool buttons// that invoke Rhino commands in the standard Macintosh toolbar.
  * Mac Rhino also has //tool palettes// that are windows containing a collection of tool buttons. \\  A tool palette of frequently-used tool buttons opens at the left of the document window when Mac Rhino starts.
  * Tool palette buttons can contain one or two commands and a menu.
  * Hover the mouse over a tool palette button to display the button's tooltip.\\  If the tooltip has two lines of text, the button contains a primary and an alternate command.
    * **Click** the tool palette button to invoke the **primary** command, .
    * To invoke the **alternate** command, hold down the **Option** key and **click** the tool button.
  * Tool palette buttons containing a menu have a small triangle in the lower left corner.
    * To open the menu, click and briefly hold the tool palette button.
  * Tool palette menus can also be displayed as floating tool palettes.
    * To display a floating tool palette, hold down the **Option** key and click and hold down the mouse button.

-->Keyboard#

  * Windows Rhino uses the **Control** key for many operations. On the Mac version, use the **Command** key instead.
    * For example, **Command** click replaces **Ctrl** click to deselect objects.
    * Also, the **Command** key replaces the **Ctrl** key for navigation shortcuts:

| | | |**Key** | **Action** | **+ Command key** |
| | | |**Left Arrow** | Rotate left | Pan left |
| | | |**Right Arrow** | Rotate right | Pan right |
| | | |**Up Arrow** | Rotate up | Pan up |
| | | |**Down Arrow** | Rotate down | Pan down |

-->Laptop issues#


**Bluetooth mouse**\\ Since laptops ship with a one-button mouse, a Bluetooth mouse such as the Logitech V270 is a useful addition.\\ \\

**Trackpad**\\ Sliding two fingers up or down on the trackpad zooms the current view in or out. \\ To change this behavior, in **Rhinoceros** > **Preferences** > **Trackpad**, you can check **Use two fingers to pan and rotate views**.\\

**Missing keyboard keys**\\ A laptop keyboard does not have a separate **Home**, **End**, **PageDn**, or **PageUp** key, but the **fn** key in combination with other keys duplicates the key function. \\

| **Key** | **+ fn key** |
| **Up Arrow** | Page Up |
| **Down Arrow** | Page Down |
| **Left Arrow** | Home |
| **Right Arrow** | End |
| **Delete** | Delete |
