=====Intro to RhinoMobile=====

**What is RhinoMobile?**
RhinoMobile is a C# .NET library for the development of 3D, cross-platform, mobile applications.  RhinoMobile - like RhinoCommon - is based on the Xamarin Mono framework, a fully-functional .NET runtime that works on Android, iOS and OS X.  RhinoMobile uses openNURBS (the 3dm NURBS library) and RhinoCommon  (the .NET SDK for Rhinoceros and Grasshopper) and handles file IO, gesture recognition and 3D display (OpenGL ES 2.0).

**Who should use RhinoMobile?**
Anyone interested in developing, prototyping, or just experimenting with 3D mobile development who wants to use C# and target as many devices as possible.  You should know some C# and .NET. Familiarity with RhinoCommon helps.

**Where can I get help?**
Visit the Rhino Forum and post your question in the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/category/rhino-developer|Rhino Developer Category]] or e-mail the developer directly: [[mailto:dan@mcneel.com|dan@mcneel.com]].
=====Getting Started=====

First, you need to decide whether you will be developing in Windows or on a Mac.

**Mac Instructions**
  - [[http://xamarin.com/download|Download and Install Xamarin]].  Download the Xamarin Starter Edition.  The installer should install the //Mono Framework//, the //Android SDK//, //Xamarin Studio//, //Xamarin.Android// and //Xamarin.iOS// (//Xamarin.Mac// is optional). Once Xamarin Studio and all the associated tools are installed, start Xamarin Studio and make sure it is up-to-date.  On the upper toolbar, navigate to //Xamarin Studio// > //Check for Updates//.  Update and restart Xamarin Studio.
  - [[http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/beginning_a_xamarin_trial|Start a Xamarin Trial]].  The Xamarin Starter edition allows you to unlock a 30-day trial of the full Business Edition, which will be necessary for using RhinoMobile.  You will need to create a Xamarin Login.  If you are unable to start a trial after creating a login, don't worry, Xamarin Studio will prompt you to when you try to build RhinoMobile projects as they use P/Invoke.
  - [[http://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12|Download and Install Xcode]].  Xcode is free and can be downloaded from the App Store on and Apple Mac running OS X Mountain Lion.  Once Xcode is installed, you will need to get the Xcode command-line tools. In Xcode 4.3 and later, Xcode Command Line Tools do not come pre-installed, but need to be downloaded from within Xcode. (//Xcode// > //Preferences// > //Downloads Panel// > //Components Tab// > //Command Line Tools//).
  - [[http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager/|Download and install the Intel Hardware Acceleration Execution Manager (HAXM)]]: HAXM provides a hardware-accelerated engine for the x86 Android emulators. It’s available to install via the Android SDK manager, but the version there is ineffective. Instead, get it from the link above. Note that you’ll want to install the revised version available on that page. Without HAXM, the emulators are nearly unusable, as their performance lags so much that they’re difficult to use. However, with it installed, the x86 emulators are responsive and usable. Not as fast as an actual device, but at least passable. HAXM will not work in a virtualized environment, e.g. a VM, so if you’re doing your Android development in a Windows VM, you will need to use a device.

**Windows Instructions**
  - [[http://xamarin.com/download|Download and Install Xamarin]].  Download the Xamarin Starter Edition.  The installer should install the //Mono Framework//, the //Android SDK//, //Xamarin Studio//, //Xamarin.Android// and //Xamarin.iOS// (//Xamarin.Mac// is optional). Once Xamarin Studio and all the associated tools are installed, start Xamarin Studio and make sure it is up-to-date.   Navigate to //Help// > //Check for Updates//.  Update and restart Xamarin Studio.
