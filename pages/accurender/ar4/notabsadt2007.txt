====== ADT 2007 Does Not Have Layout Tabs ======


=====Problem:=====
ADT 2007 opens without the layout or model tabs turned on.

This makes the AccuRender 4 tabs for Walkabout and Render unavailable and inaccessible.

=====Solution:=====

  * 1.  From the Options dialog, go to the Display tab.
  * 2.  In the Layout Elements area, check Show Layout and Model tabs.
