====== Adding Lights to Your Model ======

{{:accurender:nxt:documentation:basic:lights1.jpg|}}

Use the following procedure to add an artificial light to your drawing:

  - Draw and position the object which will serve as your light source.  Once this object is tagged as a light source, it will emit light in the pattern you choose.
  - Use the New Light dropdown button on nXt's Lighting tab to select a pattern for your light.  Four patterns are available:
       * //Omnidirectional// distributes light in all directions equally.
       * The //Spot// pattern provides a beam which you can focus.
       * //Diffuse// provides an approximation of a recessed light with a diffuser or baffles.
       * The //Photometric// pattern allows you to use a manufacturer's .ies goniometry file to describe the distribution.
  - When prompted select your object (the Photometric pattern will first prompt you for your .ies file.)
  - Provide a name for your light.
  - Hit enter to accept default values for the other prompts.
 

**Additional Notes:** 

  * By default, all lights will direct their light straight down.  Depending on your scene, you may need to aim your light in a different direction.  Before you begin the aiming process, it is often easier to have a target object to snap to.  Right click on the light in the list, and select Aim < to aim your light. The different patterns will have different prompts to follow.
  * To change the properties of your light, right click on the light in the list and select Properties.
  * Click [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:ies|here]] for additional information on IES (Photometric) lights.
