===== STEP File Utilities ======

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303|STEP file]] format is a great format for exchanging NURBS engineering data.  STEP will exchange the NURBS Solids and the Part and assembly project structure into Rhino.  

Part and Assembly files structures are quite different from Rhino's layer based structure.  but in a project situation retaining that organization of parts and assemblies can be beneficial.  Rhino translates parts and assemblies into Blocks and block instances.

==== Major STEP format version ====

Rhino supports a series of STEP versions.  Each version contains different levels of information.
