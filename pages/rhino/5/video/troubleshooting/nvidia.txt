===== Display Troubleshooting: NVIDIA =====

These instructions are for computers that have NVIDIA graphics hardware. 

If you are not sure the computer is running Nvidia, please go to **[[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:failure|Video Troubleshooting Section]]** for additional instructions.


=====Determine NVIDIA Quadro Driver Version=====
  - Start <color red>**Rhino**</color>.
  - On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
  - Expand the **View** tab (located near the bottom of the list on the left), and then click **OpenGL**.
  - Look for the **Driver Version:** line.  It will have a long number that looks like <color grey>x.xx.xxxx.xxxx</color> The last five digits of this number are the NVIDIA driver version. For instance, if the long Driver Version number is 8.17.0011.9713, then the NVIDIA driver version is 197.13.
 
If the NVIDIA driver version is equal to or larger than 340.66, then **stop**.  <color grey>(The driver is up to date as of August 2014.)</color>

If the computer has NVIDIA graphics driver version is less than 340.66, then update the driver by following the instructions below.



**Update your video driver**
  - Close Rhino.
  - Get updated video drivers.
    - **Desktop**: [[http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us|Go to the NVIDIA site]].
    - **Laptop**: Get updated drivers from the laptop maker's Web site
  - Select the **graphics card** make and model and the **Windows operating system** you're using.
  - **Download** the suggested driver **installer**. We find the 340.66 or later is prefered.
  - **Run** the installer.
  - At the point where you can **choose installation type**, select “Custom (Advanced)”
  - On the next install screen **CHECK the option** that says “Perform a clean install”
  - Continue with the install
  - **Restart** (even though the installer might not suggest it).
  - **Open Rhino** to test if your issue has been fixed.
