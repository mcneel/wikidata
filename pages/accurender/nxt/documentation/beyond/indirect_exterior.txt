====== Adding Indirect Lighting to an Exterior Rendering ======

Indirect lighting, or lighting reflected from other surfaces, can add some subtlety and realism to your exterior rendering.  In particular, you can render the undersides of overhanging features such as eaves or balconies more accurately when using indirect lighting.

This subtlety, however, comes at a substantial performance cost.  More passes are required to resolve the image, and each pass takes longer.

Use the following steps to enable indirect lighting for your exterior rendering:

  * On the **Lighting** tab, select the **Exterior** preset.
  * Check **Show Advanced Tab**.
  * On the Advanced tab, change Indirect from **Off** to **Exterior**.
