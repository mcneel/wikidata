====== The Educator's Lab ======

==== Welcome and Overview ====

The Educator’s Lab is a collaborative space for teachers who want to start, or are already teaching Rhino and Grasshopper. It’s a place to build confidence with the tools, stay up to date with new developments, grow as an educator, ask questions, get support, and connect with a community of peers working at the intersection of design, technology, and education.


==== Why Teach Rhino? ====

Anyone can teach Rhino, and we encourage you to. It’s not just another 3D tool. Rhino is a flexible, all-in-one platform where students can sketch, draft, model, render, fabricate, simulate, and code using Grasshopper. It also includes tools like Kangaroo for live physics and Rhino.Inside.Revit for advanced workflows.

Unlike subscription-based software, Rhino uses a permanent license model. For short courses, students can use a [[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/evaluation/|90-day full-featured evaluation]]. Teaching Rhino gives students one powerful tool to take a project from start to finish, with access to a rich ecosystem of plugins that add specialized tools for specific and professional workflows.

**Computational Food Design: Teaching Rhino & Grasshopper with Edible Briefs**

How do you make computational design instantly tangible and unforgettable for students? In this
Educator’s Lab session, architect and Authorized Rhinoceros Trainer Jose Carrillo (American
University in Dubai) reveals a classroom-proven framework that fuses architecture and gastronomy
to teach Rhino 8 + Grasshopper with clarity, high engagement, and chef-industry collaborations.
Jose shares concise teaching methods, standout student outcomes and awards, and an edible
Grasshopper live demo, and case studies you can adapt tomorrow. He also opens his research and
professional pipelines, demonstrating how computational design connects architecture, gastronomy,
AI and art to produce fabricable, edible, and publishable results.

**About the speaker:**

[[https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-antonio-carrillo-andrada-29518941/|Jose Carrillo]] is an architect, educator, and Ph.D. researcher in computational food design. He
explores how AI, biomaterials, and digital fabrication can reframe how we see, taste, and build. An
Authorized Rhinoceros Trainer and associate professor at AUD since 2015, he founded @archEatable
to teach Rhino + Grasshopper across architecture, art, and culinary practice. Jose coaches architects,
artists, and chefs in computational workflows that move from screen to fabrication and plates. His
work has been exhibited at the Venice Architecture Biennale, Art Dubai, and the Sikka Art & Design
Festival.
