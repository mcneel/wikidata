You can now animate RPCs with Bongo 2 WIP and Rhino 5 WIP.

__**Note â€“ Renderers supporting the technology at the moment:**__
  * **Brazil for Rhino**
  * **RhinoRender**

To add the Bongo animation data to the RPC you need to type in the following command:
**RpcSetAnimationFrame**


== How exactly do I do this? ==
  * Download and install the required files mentioned above.
  * Use the command **RPC** to insert the file
  * Place the RPC in the start location.
  * Use the command **RPCsetanimationframe** to set the frame at the start of the walk.
  * Use the Animate button on the Timeline, select RPC and move the RPC to the end of the walk position.
  * Use the command "RPCsetanimationframe" to set the last walking keyframe.
  * Under the Properties section of Rhino there is a tab for RPC, in this tab you can set the height and cast shadows.
  * Render using Rhino Render or Brazil.  
  * Use the **BongoRenderAnimation** command to make the video.
