====== QuantumTransform ======
> **Summary:** //QuantumTransform plugin for Rhino4//

\\

=====Random transformations=====

This plugin exposes tweaked versions of Move, Scale and Rotate that allow you to transform a bunch of objects with different settings simultaneously.

The transformation is random within the specified bounds.

\\

Available commands:

  * _QuantumJump    (Random translation)
  * _QuantumSwirl   (Random rotation)
  * _QuantumBloat1D (Random scaling in one direction)
  * _QuantumBloat2D (Random scaling in two directions)
  * _QuantumBloat3D (Random scaling in three directions)
  * _QuantumChaos   (All of the above)

\\

Unlike the Rhino3 version of this plugin (which was never released officially) this one has a purely command line interface, making it scriptable.

Many of the commands implements one or more of these settings:

\\

  * Randomize
    * (Calculate new random seed values for individual objects. In case you're not happy with the current distribution)
  * AllowNegative
    * (If enabled the random range is {-D to +D} rather than {0.0 to +D}. D is defined by your mouse-pointer)
  * Local
    * (If enabled each objects is transformed around its own center rather than a global base point for all objects)
  * Linked
    * (If enabled separate transformation along each axis direction share the same random value)
  * NumericInput
    * (Allows you to specify exactly what the random range is along all directions)
