======Nothing vs Empty vs Null ======
> **Developer:** //[[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses what nothing means in VBScript.//

=====Overview=====
There has always been confusion about the semantics of data that are not even there.  Usually they've written code something like:

<code vb>
If varValue = Nothing Then
</code>
 
or
 
<code vb>
If varValue = Empty Then
</code>
 
or
 
<code vb>
If varValue = Null Then
</code>
 
Why does VBScript have **Null**, **Nothing** and **Empty**, and what are the differences between them?

====Empty====
When you declare a variable in VBScript, the variable's value before the first assignment is undefined, or **Empty**.
 
<code vb>
Dim varValue ' Empty value
</code>

So basically, Empty says //I am an uninitialized variant//. If you need to detect whether a variable actually is an empty variant and not a string or a number, you can use **IsEmpty**.  Alternatively, you could use **TypeName** or **VarType**, but I prefer **IsEmpty**.

====Nothing====
Nothing is similar to Empty but subtly different.  Empty says //I am an uninitialized variant//, Nothing says //I am an object reference that refers to no object//. Objects are assigned to variables using the **Set** statement. Since the equality operator on objects checks for equality on the default property of an object, any attempt to say:

<code vb>
If varValue = Nothing Then
</code>

is doomed to failure -- Nothing does not have a default property, so this will produce a run-time error. To check to see if an object reference is invalid, use:

<code vb>
If varValue Is Nothing Then
</code>

====Null====
Null is more obscure. The semantics of Null are very poorly understood, particularly amongst people who have little experience with programming.  Empty says //I'm an uninitialized variant//, Nothing says //I'm an invalid object// and Null says //I represent a value which is not known.// Null is not True, not False, but Null! The correct way to check for Null is much as you'd do for Empty: use **IsNull** (or **TypeName** or **VarType**.)
