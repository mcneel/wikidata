====== Pascal Golay's Scripted Utilities for Rhino ======

>**Summary: **A bunch of Rhino scripts that I've made over the years

Most of these are plain RhinoScripts, but a couple are more complex and involve several scripts. I have compiled these scripts into plug-ins using the Monkey script compiler.

**Loading the scripts** 

All of these scripts are designed for drag and drop for V4 (and v5 for the most part). Extract, save, and then drag and drop the rvb files onto an open Rhino window. This will add the script to the list of scripts that load on startup (//Options>RhinoScript// page), and it adds one or more aliases to your alias list (//Options>Aliases//). Typing the alias or putting it on a button will run the script, much like a command.

**Loading the plug-ins** 

Pretty much the same as loading scripts. Unzip and save the rhp plug-in files and then drag and drop them onto an open Rhino window. You can also use //Options>Plug-ins page>Install// button to navigate to the rhp file on your disk.  The fancier ones of these add menus in Rhino.

I'll add more of these and more info about use as I go. Let me know if you run into problems with these. Most have been working pretty well for me and others but there are no doubt bugs to squish.

{{:people:setbackfillet.zip|SetbackFillet }}- Like FilletCorners but fillets to a constant setback from the corner point, not a constant radius. <color blue> //**Updated** 12/27/2012 - Tune ups to make it more reliable.//</color> Adds the following alias- **SetbackFillet**

{{:people:selparalleltoaxis_2_.zip|SelParallel }}- Select lines that are parallel to CPlane axes, or to a selected line, or to a line defined by two points. Adds the following alias- **SelParallel**

{{:people:project_direction.zip|Project by direction}} - Project curves in any direction or use the current view direction.<color blue> //**Updated** 05/30/2013 - Added   TrimFromView to allow accurate trimming with curves from the current view direction.//</color> Adds the following aliases- **ProjectDir, ProjectView, TrimFromView** 

{{:people:mirror_ex_2_.zip|MirrorEx}} - Mirror objects with some fancy options: mirror position only (objects are not inverted, position only for just text, and various nifty mirror plane options including the current cplane and selected planar surfaces. Adds the following alias- **MirrorEx**  <color blue> //**Updated** 09/1/2015 Handles mirroring multiple objects by position only.//</color> 

{{:people:distribute.zip|Distribute objects}} - Evenly distribute objects in one direction by distance between centers or by gap between objects.  <color blue> //**Updated** 11/1/2012 - No longer constrained to 2D. New options for explicitly setting gaps or center to center distance. Limited support for groups. Groups are treated as single objects, unless only a single group is selected. In that case objects are distributed within the group. Note: Group support may not work well if objects are members of more than one group. **Updated** 10/1/2014 Fixed group handling. At least the top level groups should be respected now.//</color>  Adds the following alias- **Distribute**

{{:people:retrim.zip|Retrim}} - Retrim a surface with the current trim curves.

Unlike Fillet, input curves cannot be extended at the moment. <color blue> //**Updated** 5/3/2012 to handle more cases.; **Updated** 12/19/2012 - Tuned up. Should be more reliable and make better fillets when the input curves cross one another.//</color> Adds the following alias- **FilletNonPlanar**
