====== How To: Retrieve the Unit System of the Active Document ======
> **Developer:** //[[developer:cplusplusplugins|C++]]//
> **Summary:** //Demonstrates how to determine the current unit system of the current document.//

The unit system of the active document is stored on an ON_3dmUnitsAndTolerances class that is located on the CRhinoDoc object.

If you inside of a CRhinoCommand-derived object's RunCommand() member, you can get the current units system as follows:

<code c++>
const CRhinoDocProperties& doc_props = context.m_doc.Properties();
const ON_3dmUnitsAndTolerances& units = doc_props.ModelUnitsAndTolerances();
ON::unit_system units_system = units.m_unit_system;
</code>

As a shortcut, you can do the following:

<code c++>
ON::unit_system units_system = context.m_doc.UnitSystem();
</code>

If you outside of a CRhinoCommand-derived object's RunCommand() member, you can get the current units system as follows:

<code c++>
CRhinoDoc* doc = RhinoApp().ActiveDoc();
if( doc )
{
  ON::unit_system units_system = doc->UnitSystem();
}
</code>

=====Rhino 4 Changes=====
With the addition of layouts in Rhino 4, there are now two unit systems associated with a document, model and page units. A new class has been added to [[developer:opennurbs:home|opennurbs]] call ON_UnitSystem which makes it easier to work with custom units. The Rhino document class now contains two functions

  * const ON_UnitSystem& ModelUnits() const;
  * const ON_UnitSystem& PageUnits() const;
  
=====C++=====

<code c++>
ON_UnitSystem units = doc->ModelUnits();
</code>
