====== What works and does not work in Mac Rhino ======

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of every available or missing feature, nor a list of outstanding bugs. This is intended to give an overview of the current state of Mac Rhino.

==== What works? ====

You can open, create new, modify, and save Rhino documents, including Windows Rhino documents.

You can have more than one Rhino document open at once, and work on all of them simultaneously.

You can use cut, copy, and paste, even between different Rhino documents.

Most, but not all, Rhino commands work.

Most of the Object Properties dialog is implemented. You can find it at Edit/Object Properties...

Some of the Options dialog is implemented, but not in the same way as in Windows. Since you can have more than one document open at once, the Document Properties has been split from the Application Properties. Application Properties can be found at Rhino/Preferences.. Document properties can be found at File/Settings... The Document properties dialog exists, and the Grid and Mesh panels work.

There are file importers for .DWG, .PDF, .AI, .FBX, .OBJ, .STL, and .IGES files. There are file exporters for .DWG, .AI, .FBX, .OBJ, .SAT, .STL, and .IGES files.

==== What does not work? ====

Only the Toucan renderer works in Mac Rhino. No other renderers will be implemented in the near term.

Page view does not work.

==== Mac Rhino Limitations ====

Some features are only partially implemented. This section describes some of the limitations.

There are exactly four viewports. You can change the size of the existing viewports and even shrink them to zero width, but you cannot make them disappear.

Printing is pathetic. You //can// print a document with Mac Rhino, but the printing capabilities are very limited. Mac Rhino will print the currently selected viewport, exactly as you see it. If you make the viewport larger, the printed image will be larger.

As an alternative, use the built-in renderer to create an image to print.
