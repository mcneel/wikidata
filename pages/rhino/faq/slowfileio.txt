====== Slow Paste from Clipboard ======
=== Rhino version: Any ===


**Problem:** Pasting second Rhino instance, is slow. Sometime it may take 30-40 seconds for the geometry to be added to the second instance of Rhino. 

**Background**
  * CopyClipboard is really Export Selected and Paste is really using the Import command.
  * The contents of the copy is written to a temporary file, since the clipboard typically is not sufficient.
  * Rhino calls operating system functions to read and write with standard Windows API.
  * Reading and Writing on a network drive can be slow from other applications.
  * Rhino's standard i/o calls are sent to the OS and abstracted.
  * That means that Rhino is unaware if it is reading or writing to a drive is local, removable, cloud or network.

=== Recommendations: ===

It may be best to contact the IT staff who were involved with this new server setup and tell them that file i/o across the network is slower: possibly security on the new server is tighter.
Specifically any virus detectors or antimalware that can be slowing this process down. 
Hopefully you will not have to use the workaround of deleting linked block or images.

Here is one suggestion you can try to make one local file when exporting to one file and not write the file in "chunks".

In Rhino go to Options -> Rhino Advanced and type WriteLocal. //Rhino.Options.FileSettings.WriteLocalTempFileWhenSaving// needs to be set to **True**.

We believe this is now True by default, but worth checking.
