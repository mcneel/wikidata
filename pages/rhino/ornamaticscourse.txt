====== Ornamatics course at TUDelft ======

> **Summary:** //The presentation and resulting scripts/plugins made for the [[http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=874e4cd6-fe0f-4c8c-b811-64159a7c907a&lang=en|Ornamatics]] course at the [[http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/|Architecture faculty]] at the [[http://www.tudelft.nl|TUDelft]] .//

\\

====== The course======

The object of this course was to design/develop shape and pattern based ornaments in conjunction with rapid prototyping (3D printing and milling).

This wiki page contains the resulting scripts/plugins which I wrote as well as the presentations (*.ppt) format. Unfortunately there is no record of the presentation itself.

\\

The plugins and scripts on this page are provided as-is without any guarantee. These were written to accomplish a specific task in a small amount of time and I did not put too much time into erro trapping and UI.

======Shape======

The shape part of the exercise was aimed at desiging a column fit for 3D printing. I decided to try to mimic the root structure of a tree (upside down) which maximized internal intersections (for stability and structural integrity) while minimizing sharp bends (for torque forces). Interestingly, my initial approach which set out to duplicate a natural root structure did not perform well and I had to create another, far more abstract branching algorithm.

======Pattern======

The pattern part of the exercise was aimed at desiging a 60*40 cm tile fit for 3-axis milling. I wanted to impose two conflicting patterns on the same tile, each of which would be dominant from a different distance.
