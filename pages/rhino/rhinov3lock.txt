====== V3 Rhino asks for a hardware lock ======

> **Comment:** //When Rhino V3 is installed or run on a computer running in an Asian language, Rhino requires a hardware lock.  This was a requirement of our Asian distributors.//
======You have a couple of options:======
  * If you prefer to leave your Windows system in the Asian language, you will need a parallel or USB port hardware lock.  These are available from Robert McNeel & Associates.  They are included in V3 Rhinos intended to be sold in Asia.
  * The other option is to go into the Control Panel and run the Regional and Language Options applet.  Both the "Standards and format" and the Advanced - "Language for non-Unicode programs". need to be set to US English or another Western European language.  Rhino will no longer ask for a hardware lock.

> **Note:** //For Rhino V4, this hardware lock system was replaced with a license validation system.//
