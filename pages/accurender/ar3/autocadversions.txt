** Getting AccuRender 3.1 to work in the latest version of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] **

======AutoCAD 2000-2006======

[[http://www.accurender.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi?ar3update|AccuRender 3.1 Service Release //Build 268//]] is designed to add support for all versions of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] up until [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2006.  Installing AccuRender 3 or 3.1 from your CD and then running the update installer should enable AccuRender in all supported versions of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]].

Please note that this update installer was updated 3 times for [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2004, 2005 and 2006.  If you have an older version of the update installer, it may not offer support for certain versions of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]].  If this is the case, please download the update installer again from the link above.

=====Troubleshooting:=====

In rare cases, the installation may not install support for a specific version of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]].  In this case, please follow the instructions below:

  * Open [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]].
  * Type "appload" at the command line.
  * Press the "Contents" button on the "Startup Suite" section of the dialog.
  * Press the "Add" button.
  * Navigate to "c:\program files\accuren3" and choose "ar3_2004.arx"
  * Keep pressing "OK" until you get back to [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]].  The "ar3" command should now work.



======AutoCAD 2007 and beyond======

We do not offer support in AccuRender 3.1 for [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2007 onwards.  To get AccuRender support for those products, please use AccuRender 4.0.  Note that using AccuRender 4.0's "ar3" command, it is possible to use AR4 as a working version of AR3 inside the new versions of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] if you do not have time to work out a new product.
