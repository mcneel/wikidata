=====New technique of bronze coating.=====

Rinus Roelofs - I've added some pictures of my rapid prototyping models to my website. New is the technique of bronze coating. A thin layer of bronze is put on the nylon SLS-model. //[[http://www.rinusroelofs.nl/pr-rp-models/rp-models-00.html|See model 9 and 12...]]//

As an artist I do a lot of unfoldings to realize my work. I do my unfolding with Rhino.

Later I cut them with laser (Bystronic-machines) and shape it on a rounding machine.

I work with IronCad and Rhino.
