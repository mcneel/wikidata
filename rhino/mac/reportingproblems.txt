====== Reporting Problems with Mac Rhino ======

=== Preamble ===

Most problems posted to this forum have too little information in them for us to be able to help. We would like to get your problem fixed, but first we have to duplicate the problem. This is a guide to the information we need from you.

=== Reporting a problem ===

Use the Search box in the upper right corner of this web page to search for a description of your problem.

If your problem is mentioned, add your comment to the topic. If your problem is not listed in the topics, click the **Write a New Post** button at the top of the Support page to start a new topic.

=== How Not to Write a Post ===

Please do not write "xxx does not work" or "I cannot open some DWG files" and press Post. There is nothing that describes how we can duplicate this. Please do not describe what //does not// happen; use the steps below to describe in detail what //does// happen and tell what you think is wrong.

=== How to write a post for reporting a problem ===

If you did not find your problem listed and are writing a new post, assume you are the only one having the problem. You will need to be very descriptive.

Please include a lot of information when describing your problem. We must be able to reproduce your problem in order to fix it, because if we cannot find the problem, we cannot fix it. There are many ways to perform the same or similar operation on Rhino, so we suggest the following technique:

  * Describe each step you perform to reproduce the problem. When running commands, note whether you ran a command from the application, or typed a command. Be specific when describing the command you start.
  * Describe what happened after each step.
  * If you expected different behavior, describe what you expected to happen.
  * Include a sample model to make it easy to duplicate your problem.
  * Screen shots and video links are not helpful because we cannot duplicate a problem using a screen shot.

Include a description of your hardware and software environment:

  * Open the Rhino Preferences panel.
  * Select the **OpenGL** tab. This displays a description of your computer.
  * Click the **Copy to clipboard** button. This copies the contents of the tab to your clipboard.
  * Paste the copied computer description into the post.

Does this problem occur with every file or only a particular file? If it occurs only with one file, you'll need to send us the file so we can use it to reproduce the problem.

To include a .3dm file with your post, select the **Options** tab at the top of the block. Click the **Add/Update** button.

Only one file can be attached to your post. If you want to include more than one file, select all the files you wish to include, right-click on one file and select **Compress n Items** from the menu. Attach the new Archive.zip with your post.

Instead of including a file with your post, you can submit a file directly to us. See the next section below for the procedure.

If at all possible, use one of the sample files, Help > Learn Rhino > Open Tutorial Models, when describing a problem.

=== Did Rhino crash? ===

If so, Rhino will present a Crash Report dialog the next time it starts. It is important that you also send the crash file to us.

The Crash Report dialog has a field for describing what you were doing when Rhino crashed. Use the information in this guide when filling out a crash report.

=== Sending a file to us ===

If you have a file that would help us find a problem, you can send the file to us. Go to the [[http://www.rhino3d.com/upload|McNeel File Upload]] web page. Enter your information and use **mactech@mcneel.com** as the recipient address at McNeel, and be verbose in your description of your problem.
