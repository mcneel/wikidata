Curve Piping allows you to convert curves to meshes for rendering.  Use the Object Properties "Curve Piping" option once the plug-in is installed to change the radius, accuracy, end-cap type and several other parameters.  The plug-in requires an RDK compliant renderer to work (for example, Brazil).

The Curve Piping plugin available here requires Rhino 4.0 SR3 (or later) and the [[labs:rendererdevelopmentkit10|Rhino RDK]] to run. However, it is possible you already have the RDK installed, so only download and install the RDK if you try to install the plug-in but receive the "Dependant DLL not found" error.

> **NB:** //The piped curves will not show in the rendered viewport unless you check "Render Curves" in the render properties.  They will, however, show in shaded mode and other [[rhino:opengl|OpenGL]] type modes.//
