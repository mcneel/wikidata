====== Rhino for Mac Work-In-Progress (WIP) ======

If you have purchased Rhino 5 for Mac, you have access to our Work-In-Progress (WIP) builds.  These WIP builds are where we are testing out new code: new features, bug fixes, and other improvements.

The RhinoWIP build can be run side-by-side with the stable, commercial release...they are two separate applications:

Rhinoceros (the stable-commercial release) and RhinoWIP have two separate update systems.  The applications do share preferences and a license.

*RhinoWIP will expire and SHOULD NOT be used for mission-critical work as it may be unstable.*
