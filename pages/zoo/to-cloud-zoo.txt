====== Move Rhino Licenses from LAN Zoo to Cloud Zoo ======
Make your Rhino 6 and 7 for Windows and Mac licenses available to your users anywhere in the world.

//Constant Internet connection NOT required. Only occasional access is needed every couple of weeks. //

==== Follow these step: ====

=== A - Gather required information ====

  - Open the Zoo Admin console on your Zoo server.
  - Find your serial numbers: In the Zoo Admin console, your Rhino 6 serial numbers look like ''6-1NN-NNN-NNNNN-NNNNN''.
  - Find your license keys: Search for the emails you received when you bought your Rhino 6 license keys. They contain the serial numbers from the previous step. License keys look like ''RH60-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN''. **Do not proceed until you have all the license keys.**
  - //Optional:// If you plan to create a [[https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/licensing-and-administration#domain-linked-team|domain-linked team]], ensure that you have access to the web server for your domain, or have the cooperation of an IT administrator who does.

=== B - Create a Cloud Zoo account ===

  - If you don't have an account already, visit https://accounts.rhino3d.com to create an account that will administer this team.

=== C - Create a Cloud Zoo Team ===

  - https://accounts.rhino3d.com/help#create_group
  - //Optional:// Invite additional users to be administrators for this team: https://accounts.rhino3d.com/help#invite_group_members
  - //Optional:// Link a Domain to your team at https://accounts.rhino3d.com/help#link_domain

=== D - Configure your Zoo and network ===
//To remove your license from your Zoo and add it to Cloud Zoo without help from McNeel, you'll need to ensure that your Zoo is updated and your network is configured correctly. Failure to do so will cause problems when you get to the "Add your Licenses to Cloud Zoo" step below.//

  - Install the latest Zoo from https://www.rhino3d.com/download/zoo/7/latest
  - From your Zoo server, open a web browser and visit https://api.mcneel.com
    - If you cannot see that web page, work with your network administrator to open up access to https://api.mcneel.com


=== E - Remove licenses from Zoo ===

  - Open the Zoo Admin console
  - Select one or more Rhino 6 license to remove
  - Click the Delete button in the toolbar

Note, you can't delete licenses that are in use. You have a couple of options:

  * Contact all your users and have them close Rhino.
  * Disconnect the Zoo from the network and wait 15 minutes. This will recover all the licenses, as if all the Rhino's on your LAN crashed.

=== F - Add licenses to Cloud Zoo ===

  - Visit https://www.rhino3d.com/licenses
  - Click your Team
  - Click Add License
  - Enter your license key, then click Add License

=== G - Invite users to your Team ===

== G.a. If you are using Domain Linked Teams ==

  - Email your users inviting them to create a Rhino account at https://accounts.rhino3d.com
  - Ask them to use the email address that belongs to your domain

== G.b. Or, if you are NOT using Domain Linked Teams ==
  - Visit https://accounts.rhino3d.com/?controller=groups
  - Click your Team
  - Click the Action button, then click Invite Members
  - Fill out the form, and click Send to send the invitation. 

=== H Configure Rhino to use the Cloud Zoo ===

Send the following instructions to your users after they have created an account:

  - Start Rhino
  - From the Tools menu, click Licenses
  - Under the Rhino license, click Change Your License Key
  - Click Login
  - Login using the email address that is a member of the new team.

To automate this process:
  - For Rhino 6, delete the file %PROGRAMDATA%\mcneel\rhinoceros\6.0\license manager\licenses\55500D41-3A41-4474-99B3-684032A4F4DF.lic
  - For Rhino 7, delete the file %PROGRAMDATA%\mcneel\rhinoceros\6.0\license manager\licenses\59FF75C9-9C71-4EF8-A290-6B590F3FC63A.lic (yes, it's in the rhinoceros\6.0 folder)
  - Your users will be prompted for a license, instruct them to click "Login".
