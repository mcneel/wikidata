===== Fowler Middle School =====
Hosted by: [[jbarendse@ttsd.k12.or.us|Jo Barendse]]

This an in-depth, hands-on, four-day workshop. Rhino educational resources like Rhino in Education posts, Rhino Curriculum Guide, expertise from the instructors & fellow teachers will guide us during this workshop. 
A major goal of the workshop is to get your students working in 3d with Rhino on day-one in your classes. 

Participants should be able to develop skills and projects that fit the output tools available in their own labs. The instructors and host teacher have years of classroom knowledge and expertise.  The output tools available will be different at each teaching lab; not all labs will have the same devices.
 
We need to remember the reason for the workshop is to practice working with Rhino and gaining skills, strategies, and knowledge for the classroom.  Bring a blank Flash Drive so you can take models, projects, and information back with you.  

The shop room has 30 pc computers with Rhino 6 installed. Teachers will have access to lasers with cardboard and .125 and .25 in wood. 3-D printers and vinyl cutters are also available.
