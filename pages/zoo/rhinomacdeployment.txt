=====Question=====
We recently purchased a Rhino for Mac Education Lab License. What are some strategies to help deploy it configured to use a Zoo license server on several computers at our university?

We use [[http://www.jamfsoftware.com/products/casper-suite/|Casper]] and other management systems to build packages and push applications out to client systems. This usually includes bundling the license configuration information with the distribution application.

In addition to the **LIC** file, Rhino looks for a **LicensesZooClient.Settings** file. It contains the host name or IP address of your Zoo server. See [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/findzooservermac|How Does Rhino for Mac Find a Zoo Server?]] for details.


=====Answer=====

====To Deploy Rhino 8:====

    - Install Rhino for Mac on a computer, and license it to connect to your LAN Zoo server.
    -  Rhino creates the **/Users/Shared/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0/License Manager/Licenses/59ff75c9-9c71-4ef8-a290-6b590f3fc63a.lic**
    - Deploy a copy of the license file to the same location on the target computers.
    - Change the file and folder access permissions to match (chmod 644).
    - Deploy Rhino to the target computers.

====To Deploy Rhino 7:====

    - Install Rhino for Mac on a computer, and license it to connect to your LAN Zoo server.
    -  Rhino creates the **/Users/Shared/McNeel/Rhinoceros/7.0/License Manager/Licenses/59ff75c9-9c71-4ef8-a290-6b590f3fc63a.lic**
    - Deploy a copy of the license file to the same location on the target computers.
    - Change the file and folder access permissions to match (chmod 644).
    - Deploy Rhino to the target computers.

====To Deploy Rhino 6:====

    - Install Rhino for Mac on a computer, and license it to connect to your LAN Zoo server.
    -  Rhino creates the **/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/6.0/License Manager/Licenses/55500d41-3a41-4474-99b3-684032a4f4df.lic**
    - Deploy a copy of the license file to the same location on the target computers. 
    - Set the file and folder access permissions to match (chmod 644).
    - Deploy Rhino to the target computers.


====To Deploy Rhino 5:====

    - Install Rhino for Mac on a computer, and license it to connect to your LAN Zoo server.
    - Rhino creates the **/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/License Manager/Licenses/781b000c-8d0b-4ed3-8ead-213bdb848f39.lic**
    - Rhino creates **/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/License Manager/LicensesZooClient.settings**
    - Deploy both files to the same location on the target computers. 
    - Change the file and folder access permissions to match (chmod 644).
    - Deploy Rhino to the target computers.



**NOTES:** 

    - A common mistake is to confuse ///Library// (the global library) and ///Users/[user_account]/Library// (the user's library).  Please make sure you are looking in the global library.
    - Also, Rhino 6 and Rhino 7 create the Zoo license files under **License Manager** in explicit **6** & **7** subfolder, while Rhino 5 creates its files in the root of **License Manager** and **License** subfolder. In other words, Rhino 5 does not create a **5** subfolder.
    - For standalone licenses, the license file file is encrypted, unreadable, and unique per system. It cannot be copied to different computers for deployment.
    - For LAN Zoo and Cloud Zoo licenses, the license file is clear text, and can be moved between one system and another.
