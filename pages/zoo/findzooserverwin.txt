=====How does Rhino for Windows find a Zoo server?=====

When Rhino needs a license from a Zoo server, it determines the name of the Zoo server by looking in the following locations in this order:
  - The Current User hive of the Windows Registry. Looks for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server.
  - The Local Machine hive of the Windows Registry. Looks for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server.
  - Queries your Domain Name System (DNS) server for the default Zoo server name.
 

=====More information=====

====Registry Lookup - Current user====

When searching in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, of the Windows Registry, for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server, both 32-bit and 64-bit Rhino will look in this location:

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_CURRENT_USER
Key:   Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager
Name:  Server
Type:  REG_SZ
Value: <host name or IP address>
</code>

====Registry Lookup - Local machine====
If you are using a 32-bit version of Windows, then when searching in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, of the Windows Registry, for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server, Rhino 32-bit will look in this location:

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager
Name:  Server
Type:  REG_SZ
Value: <host name or IP address>
</code>

If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, then when searching in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, of the Windows Registry, for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server, both 32-bit and 64-bit Rhino will look in this location:

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager
Name:  Server
Type:  REG_SZ
Value: <host name or IP address>
</code>

====Using DNS====
If Rhino fails to determines the name of the Zoo server, by searching in the Windows Registry, then it will query your DNS server for the default Zoo server, which is the following host name:

<code>
__mcneel.__zoo5
</code>

For example, if your company's domain is //mcneel.com//, then you can add a DNS alias of //<nowiki>__mcneel.__zoo5.mcneel.com</nowiki>// which points to your Zoo server.
