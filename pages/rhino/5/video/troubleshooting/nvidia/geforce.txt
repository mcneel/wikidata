=====Determine NVIDIA Driver Version=====
  - Start <color red>**Rhino**</color>.
  - On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
  - Expand the **View** tab (located near the bottom of the list on the left), and then click **OpenGL**.
  - Look for the **Driver Version:** line.  It will have a long number that looks like <color grey>x.xx.xxxx.xxxx</color> or <color grey>x.xx.xx.xxxx</color>  The last five digits of this number are the NVIDIA driver version. For instance, if the long Driver Version number is 8.17.0011.9713, then the NVIDIA driver version is 197.13.
 
If the NVIDIA driver version is equal to or larger than 340.66, then **stop**.  <color grey>(The driver is up to date.)</color>

If the computer has NVIDIA graphics driver version is less than 340.66, then update the driver by following the instructions in either the GeForce or the Quadro section.
