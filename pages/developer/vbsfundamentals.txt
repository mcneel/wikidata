=====Overview=====

VBScript (short for Visual Basic Scripting Edition) is an easy-to-use scripting language developed by Microsoft that enables authors to create powerful tools using a subset of the Visual Basic language. VBScriptis implemented as a fast, portable interpreter for use in web browsers and applications that use ActiveX controls and OLE Automation servers.

If you already know Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), VBScript will be very familiar. Even if you do not know Visual Basic, it should not take you long to get up-to-speed as VBScriptis a relatively easy language to learn and use.

RhinoScript is a plug-in for Rhino that implements Active Scripting. In addition to providing support for VBScript, RhinoScript also runs as an OLE Automation server that exposes the internal workings of Rhino to automation.
