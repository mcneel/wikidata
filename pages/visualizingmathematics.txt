===== Description =====
Mathematician **Henry Segerman** will show you beautiful and compelling 3D printed mathematical art, and in the second half of the presentation, show you how to make a “stereographic projection” shadow sculpture using Rhino. Henry will broaden your exposure to visual mathematical ideas.

===== Target Audience =====
The first part of the presentation is aimed at anyone interested in geometric art and design. The second part is for Rhino users interested in learning a new way to have geometry interact with light and shadow. No prior mathematical experience will be assumed or needed.

===== Order of Event =====
Duration: 1 hr 30 minutes. 
(Webinar may go longer with additional questions.)
  * Intro
  * Overview of Henry Segerman’s work
  * Break for questions
  * Workshop to make a stereographic projection sphere. 
  * More questions after (and during) the workshop.

===== The Presenter =====
Henry Segerman received his masters in mathematics from the University of Oxford in 2001, and his Ph.D. in mathematics from Stanford University in 2007. After post-doctoral positions at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Melbourne, he joined the faculty at Oklahoma State University in 2013. 

His research interests are in three-dimensional geometry and topology, working mostly on triangulations of three-manifolds, and in mathematical, art and visualization. In visualization, he works mostly in the medium of 3D printing, with other interests in spherical video, virtual, and augmented reality. 

He is the author of "Visualizing Mathematics with 3D Printing”, a popular mathematics book published by Johns Hopkins University Press in July 2016.
