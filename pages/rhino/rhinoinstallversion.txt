=====Question=====
How do I tell what version is installed?

=====Answer=====
Once you have the software installed, you can see the date and the SR number by viewing the "about" information, which appears on the splash screen when you start Rhino, or can be viewed by going to //Rhino > Help > About Rhinoceros//.

For Flamingo, do the **FlamingoAbout** command. For Bongo, do the **BongoAbout** command.
