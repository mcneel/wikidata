====== Deleting Plug-In Data from Multiple Files ======
There are times when you want to remove plug-in data from a file. This is done in Rhino by using the **-SaveAs** command.

  - At command line type **-SaveAs**
  - Command prompt: //Save file name <C:\NAME.3dm> ( Version=5  SaveSmall=No  GeometryOnly=No  SaveTextures=No  SavePlugInData=Yes  Browse ):// 
  - Click on **SavePlugInData=Yes ** It will toggle to **SavePlugInData=No**
  - Save file name <C:\NAME.3dm> ( Version=5  SaveSmall=No  GeometryOnly=No  SaveTextures=No  SavePlugInData=No  Browse ):
  - Rhino echos //File successfully written as C:\SHARE\test.3dm//

===== Batch processing =====
This works well for one file. But what if you need to process an entire folder and possibly subfolders of files? You need this script.

=== Download ===
  * [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/mcneel/rhinoscript/BatchRemovePlugInDataV5.zip|BatchRemovePlugInDataV5.zip]] for Rhino 5.
  * Unzip into a folder that you will remember and not move or delete.
  * You can also get more information on this script on [[https://github.com/mcneel/rhinoscript/blob/master/BatchRemovePlugInDataV5.rvb|GitHub.]]
=== How to use===
  - Open Rhino 5 to a new empty file.
  - Drag and drop **BatchRemovePlugInDataV5.rvb** on top of the Rhino application window. 
  - Type **BatchRemovePlugInData** 
  - Select the folder to process. //Let it roll//.


===Be careful! ===
  * Test thoroughly with a small number of files. Make sure the files still work properly with any plug-ins like Matrix, V-Ray, RhinoGold, RhinoCAM and others that you may be using.
  * This utility will process all the files in a folder and its sudfolders.
  * Arrange your directory structure so that files that you do not need processed are not in the folder or subfolder that you select.
