===== Course Outline =====

In this comprehensive 1-day intro class you'll learn the basics of creating and editing accurate 3-D models. This fast-moving class covers how to start using Rhino and developing models for both rendering and digital fabrication. The day will start with an intro and progress rapidly to more advanced surfacing commands and preparing the models for 3D pritning. this is designed to be "hand on class", however, fell free to join in even without a computer.

===== Structure =====

In this class, you will systematically move through the user interface, command access, creation and
editing curves, surfaces and solids.

==== Expected Outcomes ====
After this course the student is expected to be able to:
  * Utilize the features of the Rhino user interface
  * Create basic graphic objectsâ€”lines, circles, arcs, curves, solids, and surfaces
  * Model with precision
  * Modify curves and surfaces with edit commands and Gumball
  * Use control point editing to modify curves and surfaces
   * Export and import models to STL and from different file formats
  * Render the model using Rhino Render
  * 3D Printing
  * Rhino Training Guides (Level 1 and Level 2 Curriculum can be used by your school for free)
  * Rhino Certification Testing (Parallels the Level 1 and Level 2 Curriculum Guide)
  * Other advanced topics as time permits

===== What to bring =====
    * The instructors will be using **Rhinoceros 6 for Windows**. and have Rhino 5 for Mac available for demonstration.
    * A Windows computer with the latest [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5/latest|Rhinoceros 6 for Windows (full or Evaluation)]] 
    * **Rhino 5 for Windows** ok, but Rhino 6 Eval is prefered.
    * Or a Mac with **Rhino 5 for Mac**[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5/evaluation|Rhino for Mac]] (full or eval) installed.
    * Also you will need a three button mouse** (we like this [[https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-3-Button-Optical-Wheel-Mouse/dp/B000H51GA6|mouse]] for both Windows and Mac)and your desire to learn!
    * Previous drafting and modeling experience is helpful, but not required.
