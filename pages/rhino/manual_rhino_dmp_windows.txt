====== Manually Creating a Memory Dump (DMP File) from an Unresponsive Rhino for Windows ======
Back to [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/faq#display_problems|FAQ]]

===== Problem: ===== 
There are times when Rhino may become unresponsive and appear frozen. Despite your efforts, there doesn’t seem to
be anything that you can do to bring it back. 

Rhino may have crashed and has not fully shut down.
It just sits there on your screen. 

In these cases, it is possible to manually create a “memory dump” or **DMP** file from 
the Rhino in its current condition. 
Rhino developers can then use the DMP to discover where Rhino got stuck and why it
appears to be frozen. 

===== Steps to Creating a DMP File for Support =====
The following steps outline the process for manually creating a dump or **DMP** file.

1. Once you realize that Rhino is in an unresponsive state, start the **Task Manager** by right-clicking
on the **Task Bar** and select **Task Manager** in the popup menu that appears.

2. Look at the **Task Manager** window, make sure the **Processes** tab is selected, and locate the
**Rhino** process. Right-click on the **Rhino** process and select **Create dump file** in the
popup menu that appears.

**Note:** If you do not see the dialog that has the tabs **Process and Performance**, pick **More Details** at the bottom.

3. Windows will start creating a dump file in your temporary folder on your system.

4. Once Windows has finished creating the dump file, you will be shown the name and location of
the file. Next, select the file to copy and paste.

5. Next locate the file on your system in **File Explorer**. ZIP or compress the file before uploading. 

6. The DMP file will be too big to attach to an email. Please use our upload system [[https://www.rhino3d.com/upload|here]]. Use **tech@mcneel.com** as the recipient. Include the details in the note field about what you were doing in Rhino when the problem occurred.
