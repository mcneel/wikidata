====== Frequently Given Answers -- Rhino ======

==How do I send a crash report?==
  * Can you repeat the crash? If so, the developers would like to get the specific details needed to repeat the crash. A repeatable problem is the only good way of finding and fixing problems in software.
  * When Rhino crashes, if there is enough memory available, the crash reporting system starts. Please enter your email address and describe what you were trying to do when Rhino crashed. A short list of the commands you were using just prior to the crash can be helpful.
  * If possible, please check the box to send your 3dm file with the report.
  * If you include your email address and a description, **your report will be analyzed by a human**. If you don't include your email address and a description, we will use an automated process to analyze the crash report.

==Safe Mode==
  * There is a shortcut in the Rhinoceros Program group. Safe mode is a troubleshooting tool that blocks OpenGL and plug-ins from loading. In V5 it also blocks loading of toolbars and the RDK. I would normally answer Yes to loading them. Safe Mode is a troubleshooting tool, and is not intended as a working mode.

----
==Disable V5 Plug-ins==
  -Go into Tools - Options - Plug-ins, and remove the check mark in the Enable column for all of the plug-ins that did not ship with Rhino.
  -Restart Rhino normally and verify that the crash problem is gone. Re-enable one of the plug-ins, restart Rhino, and see if you can repeat the crash. If not, the plug-in you enabled wasn't the problem. Repeat the identification process cycle again until you find the offending plug-in

==Rhino V5 won't start==
  * This problem could be bad display drivers or a bad plug-in. Here's what to do to narrow it down. Start Rhino in Safe mode (there is a shortcut in the Rhinoceros Program group), and in Tools - Options - View - OpenGL, REMOVE the check for the top option for using Accelerated hardware. Close Rhino and start normally. If it starts without crashing, the problem was probably the display driver. Go look for an update for it. If Rhino still crashes after downloading and installing an updated display driver, then the problem most likely is a plug-in.

  * In that case, restart in Safe mode, ADD the check back for accelerated hardware graphics. Then go into Tools - Options - Plug-ins, and remove the checks in the Enabled box for all of the plug-ins you have installed that did not ship with Rhino, and check the "Ask to load..." at the bottom. Then restart Rhino normally (not safe mode), and when asked to load them answer No to all. If Rhino comes up, the problem is one of the load protected plug-ins. Restart Rhino normally again, and this time, answer Yes to loading the first plug-in and No to the rest. If it crashes when loading the first one, that plug-in is the problem. If it doesn't crash, it's not.  Go back into the Plug-ins page and enable that one. Restart again and repeat that process until you find the crashing plug-in.

==Can I install my Rhino on both of my computers?==
  * Yes. Your license agreement allows you to install your Rhino on all of the computers that you directly control, provided that you run your Rhino on only one computer at a time. You can not "loan" your Rhino to a friend.

==Installing upgraded versions of Rhino==
  * **//Question://** //"What previous version info do I need to get my Rhino 5 **Upgrade** to install?"// 
  * **//Answer://** The Rhino 5 Upgrade installer will install if one of the following is true.
  
  * It is checked in order:
<code>
    Rhino 4.0 is installed
    Rhino 3.0 is installed
    Rhino 2.0 is installed
    Rhino 4.0 key code is entered during installation
    Rhino 3.0 key code is entered during installation
    Rhino 2.0 key code is entered during installation
</code>    
  * There is no need to actually install previous versions, just have the key codes ready.

==When I try to open a file, I get an error message about something being unreadable==
  * Here's how the system works. there are two parts:
    - Autosave - If you have Autosave turned on in Rhino, then temporary files are written to the folder specified in options, and a flag is set that rhino is running. When Rhino closes normally, it deletes this autosave file and Rhino clears the flag. If Rhino crashes, the flag was not cleared and the autosave file still exists when Rhino starts the very next time. In that event, you are warned that Rhino did not close properly and you have this one chance to save your work from the autosave file. If you say no, you lose the file.
    - Backups - As of V4 SR7, we added an automatic backup feature. If the feature has not been disabled, then when you open an existing file, the changes in this new editing session are saved to a new copy of the file and the existing file you opened has ".bak" concatenated to its name and the file is left in the same folder.
  * V5 now makes *.3dmbak files and has a file type listing to open them.
  * For V4, use your file Explorer in a List or Detailed view, with Windows Folder Options set to show the file extensions for known file types, and rename the file from [filename].3dm.bak to [newfilename].3dm. Then you can open it like any other Rhino 3dm file.

==I checked the option to use the Zoo when I installed Rhino, and I don't use the Zoo==
  * On Windows Vista or Windows 7, delete all the files in: C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager\Licenses. 
  * On Windows XP delete all the files in: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager\Licenses
  - Restart Rhino.
  - Enter your key when asked.

Note: On some systems, instead of the "\All Users\" folder, the path may be your "\Domain\" log in name.
