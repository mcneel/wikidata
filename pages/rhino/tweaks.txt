======Tweaking Rhino's Interface======
>//Tips and tweaks for enhancing Rhino's interface via registry editing or external scripting//.

=====Changing the world axis icon colors=====

**Note** This is the small 3-axis indicator in the lower left corner of your viewport, normally dark grey.

====For Rhino 3.0====
**//First close all instances of Rhino, then run Regedit.//**

Edit the following registry key:
//HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\3.0\Scheme:Default\Options\AppearanceSettings//

The last three keys are the icon colours. Enter an RGB value for each
(for example 0,255,0 for green or 255,255,0 for yellow).

====For Rhino 4.0 and 5====

These settings are now mostly accessible directly from the Rhino interface.  The icon colors are adjustable individually for each display mode. There is no global setting.

In **Options > Appearance > Advanced Settings**, for each display mode (Wireframe, Shaded, etc.), expand the tree and go to the Grid section.  Under //World Axes Settings//, you will find three choices:
  *//Use application settings// will use the standard gray
  *You can set them to be the same as the normal CPlane X,Y,Z axis colors
  *Or specify another custom color scheme 

You will need to do this for **all** display modes you want to customize.

If you want to change the default //application settings// dark gray, follow the same procedure for editing the registry as above for Rhino 3.0 -- Just edit the key //Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\**4.0**\Scheme:Default\Options\AppearanceSettings//

=====Reallocating the second and third mouse buttons=====

<color darkslategray> This change will swap the middle mouse button with the right mouse button, for those who are used to having the middle button manipulate the view.</color>

**Important** In Rhino 5, this is no longer necessary. This functionality is included in Options > Mouse.


//Close all instances of Rhino before making these changes.//

Edit the following registry key:
//HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\3.0(or 4.0)\Scheme:Default\Options\MouseSettings//

===In this registry key you will find the following eight entries:===

middle_mouse_dblclk_remap       3\\ 
middle_mouse_down_remap         3\\ 
middle_mouse_move_remap         3\\ 
middle_mouse_up_remap           3\\ 
right_mouse_dblclk_remap        2\\ 
right_mouse_down_remap          2\\ 
right_mouse_move_remap          2\\ 
right_mouse_up_remap            2\\ 

Simply edit each one of these entries, replacing the 3's for 2's and the 2's for 3's.\\ 
The result should be:

middle_mouse_dblclk_remap       2\\ 
middle_mouse_down_remap         2\\ 
middle_mouse_move_remap         2\\ 
middle_mouse_up_remap           2\\ 
right_mouse_dblclk_remap        3\\ 
right_mouse_down_remap          3\\ 
right_mouse_move_remap          3\\ 
right_mouse_up_remap            3\\ 

**//And youâ€™re done!//**
