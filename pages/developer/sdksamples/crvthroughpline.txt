===== Question =====
I have a polyline curve and I want to do what the **CurveThroughPolyline** does when "Curvetype=ControlPoint" and I want to specify a degree. Is there an SDK function do to this?

===== Answer =====
I don't believe there is an SDK function to do this. But writing your own function is not too difficult - see below.

==== C++ ====
<code c++>
ON_NurbsCurve* RhControlPointsCurveThroughPolyline(
    const ON_Polyline& polyline, 
    int degree
    )
{
  const int count = polyline.Count();
  if( count < 2 )
    return 0;

  degree = ( count <= degree) ? count - 1 : degree;

  ON_NurbsCurve* curve = ON_NurbsCurve::New();
  if( curve )
  {
    bool rc = false;
    if( polyline.IsClosed() )
      rc = curve->CreatePeriodicUniformNurbs( 3, degree + 1, count - 1, polyline );
    else
      rc = curve->CreateClampedUniformNurbs( 3, degree + 1, count, polyline );

    if( !rc )
    {
      delete curve;
      curve = 0;
    }
  }

  return curve;
}
