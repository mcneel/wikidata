====== Rhino for Mac Crashed - Now What? ======


When Rhino for Mac crashes, you'll get a spinning beach ball for a little while, and eventually this dialog will appear:

{{:undefined:rhinocrash.png?direct|}}

**DO NOT** click the **OK** button on this dialog. This send a report to Apple, not to us, and we will never see it.

**To send a crash report to McNeel**

  - Click the **Reopen** button on this dialog. This will restart Rhino. Rhino detects that it crashed the previous time it was run, and displays the **Rhino Crash Report** dialog:
  - Fill in a description of what you were doing when Rhino crashed so that we can duplicate your problem and fix it. It is important to include enough detail so that we can repeat the crash. This creates an email message and sends the crash report via email to Robert McNeel & Associates. The email message will contain only the information you see in the Problem and System Information box and your own description of the problem.
  - Click the **Send to McNeel** button. Rhino for Mac will finish launching.
