====== Manually Creating a Memory Dump or DMP File from Unresponsive An Rhinoceros ======
Back to [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/faq#display_problems|FAQ]]

===== Problem: ===== 
There are times where Rhino may become unresponsive and appear frozen. Despite your efforts, there doesn’t seem to
be anything that you can do to bring it back. 

Rhino may have crashed, and has not fully shut down.
It is just sitting there on your screen. 

In these cases, it is possible to manually create a “memory dump” or **DMP** file from 
the Rhino in its current condition. 
The DMP can then be used by developers to hopefully discover where Rhino is stuck and why it
appears to be frozen. 

===== Steps to Creating a DMP File for Support =====
The following steps outline the process for manually creating such a dump or **DMP** file.

1. Once you realize that Rhino is in an unresponsive state, start the **Task Manager** by right-clicking
on the **Task Bar** and select **Task Manager** in the popup menu that appears.

2. Looking at the **Task Manager** window, make sure the **Processes** tab is selected and locate the
**Rhino 6** process. Right click on the **Rhino 6** process and select **Create dump file** in the
popup menu that appears.

3. Windows will start creating a *dump* file in your temporary folder on your system.

4. Once Windows has finished creating the dump file, you will be shown the name and location of
the file. Next select the file for copy and paste purpose.

5. Next locate the file on your system in **File Explorer**. ZIP or compress the file before uploading. 

6. The DMP file will be too big to attach to an email. Please use our upload system [[https://www.rhino3d.com/upload|here]]. Use **tech@mcneel.com** as the recipient. Include details in the note field as to what you were doing in Rhino when the problem occurred.
