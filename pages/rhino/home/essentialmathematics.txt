=====Overview=====

Are you new to generative design but lack the mathematical basis? Check out Rajaa Issa's Essential Mathematics video series. We have chopped down the material into byte size videos to help you grasp the basics of math needed to make real progress in any algorithmic design environment! 


=====Intro to Algorithmic Design=====

Learn the main differences between traditional 3D modeling and algorithmic modeling. (4 minutes):

=====Intro to Vectors=====

What are vectors and what do we need them for? In this video, Rajaa explains how vectors are a way of defining length and direction. Vectors help define, orient or move geometry in 3D modeling space. (4'19"):

=====Position Vectors=====

Learn why a position vector is a special case, how to find the coordinates for the tip point of a vector and why vectors and points can sometimes get confused. (4'55"):
