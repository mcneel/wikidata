====== Rhino 8 Mac with Enscape Reporting "License Not Found" ======
Rhino 8 Mac with Enscape installed, sometimes reports "License not found" error and will not open.

{{:rhino:mac:home:license_not_found.png?300|}}

This happens because Rhino was not initialized  before Enscape was install and Enscape created ~/Library/Application Support/McNeel with wrong permissions.

The "fix" is to remove Enscape and all supporting files and then re-install and run Rhino **first** before re-installing Enscape.
 
1. Restart your Mac.

2. Make sure Rhino 8 is not running.

3. Launch Terminal.

4. Remove the folders that Enscape created.

- (a) If Rhino 7 is installed and working and you only want to fix Rhino 8, run 
**rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0**

- (b) Otherwise, run **rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel**

5. Start Rhino 8

6. With Rhino successfully starting, now you can reinstall Enscape

7. if you get "permissions denied" as a return when you run the steps above, add the prefix **sudo** then a space, then the command string above. 
this will call the admin credentials dialog box allowing you to enter admin credentials. Enter admin credentials and the command string
should complete successfully. 

8. If all the above fails, you can browse directly to the folder in the finder and delete the folder manually by dragging it into 
the trash. (confirm with admin credentials) 

9. In some rare cases all the above fails, BUT after a restart the above process finally works.
