====== Exporting Windows Display Modes to Rhino for Mac ======

Display modes can be exported out for **Rhino for Windows** and imported in **Rhino for Mac**. 
However, there is one step you may not be aware of. **Rhino for Windows** export the INI in text format in **UTF-16-LE**. Programs on the Mac can not read this format. {{::windows.png?400|}}

After exporting the **INI** from **Rhino for Windows**, open in in //Notepad// and save it as **UTF-8** or **ASCI**. 
Then send it to to your Mac computer and import.
