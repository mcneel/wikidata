====== Rhino 7 SubD Tutorials ======

> **Summary:** Rhino 7 includes a new Sub-D Geometry Type to allow for more flexible modeling.  Rhino's SubD are accurate and repeatable.  This allows our SubD to be converted to NURBS for fabrication.

=====Exploring SubD in the Rhino 7 WIP=====

Did you know Rhino 7 WIP has SubD tools? Join Brian James in this video where he explores the use of the SubD creation and editing tools that have currently been added to V7. (8 minutes)

=====An Introduction to SubD in Rhino3d v7=====

| [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIbsNurVdb0|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:subd-phil_cook.png?direct&300 |}}]] | In this video Phil Cook from Simply Rhino takes a look at SubD, or Subdivision Surface Modelling, that is being developed for Rhino v7.(37 minutes)|

Traditionally SubD objects are mesh based and lend themselves well to more approximate types of modelling such as character modelling and creating smooth organic forms that are controlled in an approximate fashion. Rhino SubD objects are, however, high precision spline based surfaces and thus introduce a level of accuracy to the process of creating complex freeform shapes. The video starts by examining SubD surfaces and how these compare to NURBS before moving on to look at some examples of how and why SubD can be used alongside the traditional NURBS workflow in Rhino. Simply Rhino are the most popular Rhino3D reseller in the UK, they offer expert training and support for Rhino and all key Rhino plugins.

=====Modeling a Coin Frame in the Rhino 7 SubD=====

| [[https://youtu.be/IB8ET_pI5_k|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:subd-trav-coin.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | Learn how to use the new QuadRemesh command and SubD tools in Rhino3D to model a jewelry coin frame. SubD modeling is one Rhino's new capabilities. You can quickly sculpt and edit soft transitions. (5 minutes)|

=====SubD Fun in Rhino 7 WIP!=====

| [[https://youtu.be/SWKk2KBsdb4|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:subd-giuseppe-dog.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | In this quick video, Giuseppe Massoni shows us how you can swiftly turn a SubD sphere into a dog. He uses simple push and pull techniques on subdivision faces and control net points, using the Gumball. You'll note the ability to add creases as well. (1 minute)|


=====New SubD Reflect command, a symmetric copy=====

| [[https://youtu.be/yDZ4y-ZbBkM|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:subd-reflect-giuseppe.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | In this short tutorial, Giuseppe Massoni quickly walks us through Rhino's 7 new command: Reflect. This command allows you to make a symmetric copy of the object while maintaining the smooth connection between the mirrored copies. A much needed tool for SubD sculpting.(1 minute)|


=====Building Modeling with SubD Tools in Rhino 7=====

| [[https://youtu.be/T9tZ68Wk6oM|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:rhino7-subd-building.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwImuwbI4lKk544-FS7A2Yw|How to Rhino]] takes a look at Rhino 7 Work in Progress version and new SubD tools that are on a good track to replace T-splines plugin for Rhino 5 that was the king of SubD modeling. In this tutorial, we will be going over some simple techniques using these new Rhino modeling tools in order to create this conceptual project designed by @archihab.|


=====Reverse engineering surfaces with SubD=====

| [[https://youtu.be/WpaSq2j-Mvk|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:rhino7-subd-reverse-last.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | Using rhino v7 wip this video shows the combination of quadremesh and SubD to converted meshes to nurbs. (59'47")|
