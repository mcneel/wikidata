====== Using Rhino Remotely During COVID-19 ======

During the corona virus outbreak, a growing number of schools and companies are mandating that people learn and work remotely. The ways McNeel supports working from home vary by the version of Rhino and what kind of customer you are.

Float your licenses using one of these methods:

  * **[[https://www.rhino3d.com/zoo|Zoo]]** works best in a school or company LAN, and with additional configuration can work over VPN connections. Works with Rhino 5 and 6.
