===== Question =====
The [[http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/16053049-7db2-4c9f-961a-53274ac92ace|RhinoCommon Project Wizard]] creates a skeleton plug-in project with a single command. However, the wiki says it is possible for a plug-in to contain more than one command. How can I add additional commands to my plug-in project?

==== Answer ====
To add a new command to your RhinoCommon plug-in project, you simply need to define a new class that inherits from **Rhino.Commands.Command**.

An easy way to do this is to just use the **Empty RhinoCommmon Command** template. Here is how you do that:

  - Make sure you have the [[http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/16053049-7db2-4c9f-961a-53274ac92ace|RhinoCommon Project Wizard]] installed.
  - Launch Visual Studio and open your plug-in project.
  - From Visual Studio, pick the **Project -> Add New Item** menu item.
  - Select the **Empty RhinoCommmon Command** template from the list of installed templates.
  - Provide a unique file name that relates to the command you are adding.
  - Click the **Add** button.
