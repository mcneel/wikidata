> **Summary:** //Discusses the limitations of the openNURBS toolkit.//

===== Overview =====
openNURBS is an open source toolkit for reading and writing models in the 3DM format. 

Our full-featured development platform is Rhino.

===== More Information =====
Although the openNURBS toolkit appears to be a full-featured geometry library, it is not. The toolkit does not include a number of important features, including:

  * Closest point calculations
  * Intersection calculations
  * Surface tessellation
  * Interpolation
  * Area and mass property calculations
  * Other

Note, all of these features are found in the [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/developer/cplusplusplugins|Rhino SDK]], the toolkit used to build plug-ins for Rhino.
