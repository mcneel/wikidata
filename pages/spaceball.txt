====== Discontinued Support for 3dconnexion: SpaceTraveler, SpacePilot, SpaceBall ======
The support for [[https://www.3dconnexion.com/|3dConnexion]] devices in Rhino is written by 3dConnexion, not McNeel. 
We distribute the 3dxRhino plug-in with Rhino on their behalf.

This [[https://www.3dconnexion.com/index.php?id=200&faq_red=faq/39|link]] is provided by **3dConnexion**, which lists the obsolete devices.

According to **3Dconnexions** web site: 
//Our approach when a device becomes obsolete: we stop testing. That’s it. We don’t remove (or add) code to our software that in any way will specifically block a device type just because software support has ended.//

McNeel also does not add any code to block devices in the Rhino 6 (or even 7) plug-in. 
3Dconnexions notifies its customers with a clear date when devices will be obsolete. 
This notice is issued years in advance as you can see in the web page you linked to: the page is updated when a device enters “end-of-life”.

We understand your frustration, however **3dConnexion's** has their own approach to obsolete hardware that is out of our control.
