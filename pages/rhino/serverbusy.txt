====== Server Busy Error ======
This error can occur when opening or closing any version of Rhino for Windows.

{{ :rhino:server_busy.png?400|}}

It is very difficult to tell what is going wrong from these very unhelpful & painful Windows dialog boxes.
The server in the **//Server Busy//** dialog is not referring to our license server.

It is a somewhat generic Windows error dialog
This is related to a **COM server** running on your computer itself.

==== Recommendations to Fix this issue: ====
  - Apply all Microsoft updates.
  - Download and install the latest Rhino [[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/|here]].
  - Reboot the computer.
  - Open Windows **TaskManager** and end the task for any Rhino processes that are still open.
  - Reboot at least every week as part of your computer maintenance.
