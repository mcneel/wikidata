=====Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs)=====

**The Vertices**

The vertices of our DisplayMesh are fed to the GPU as an object called a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO).  This is a diagram of how a simple, vertex only Vertex Buffer Object would look like in memory:

<code c#>
public struct VData {  //This is a redundant struct, but it's for example purposes only
        public Point3f Vertex;
}
</code>

**Adding a normal vector**

<code c#>
public struct VNData  {
	public Point3f Vertex;
	public Vector3f Normal;
}
</code>

This is a diagram of how an interleaved Vertex and Color VBO would look like in memory:

**Color too!**

We define a simple struct for our VertexColor VBO in code like this:

<code c#>
public struct VCData {
	public Point3f Vertex;
	public Color4f Color;
}
</code>
