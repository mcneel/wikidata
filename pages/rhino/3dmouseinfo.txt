**Why does my Spaceball-type device not work correctly?**

//After upgrading from Rhino 3.0 to 4.0, I noticed that my SpacePilot doesn't do anything beyond rotate. I have lost the ability to configure my buttons, views, and worst of all, the "fit" button no longer works. I have the latest drivers from// http://www.3dconnexion.com.

**Answer**

The executable file name has changed between Rhino 3.0 and Rhino 4.0. If the driver does not load your Rhino configuration, open the %%Rhinoceros.scg%% file under en_us/profiles/default in the 3DxWare directory and change the EXECUTABLES name to **rhino4.exe**. Then restart the driver and Rhino. The link for the latest driver fixes this problem: http://www.3dconnexion.com/support/4a1.php  

It's definitely worth updating every eight weeks or so, just for bug fixes and version updates.
