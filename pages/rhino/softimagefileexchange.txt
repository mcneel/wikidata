====== Softimage File Exchange ======

There are three options for getting [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] models from Rhino into Softimage. All three have their own problems and benefits.


Softimage can also import 3DS, DXF, and OBJ file formats created in Rhino.

=====Use Softimage's file utility:=====
  - From the File menu, click Export Selected or Save As.
  - In the dialog box, in the Save as type box, select IGES.
  - Type a filename and click Save.
  - In the IGES Export dialog box, from the IGES Type box, select Softimage.
  - Run iges2soft.exe with the following command line switches:
   iges2soft -f -L -S3 -s3 -T5 -t3 -v3 -R [RSRC_DIR] MyIgesFile.igs MyDSCFile.dsc
   [RSRC_DIR] = Softimage resource directory (often c\soft3d_3.7\3d\bin\rsrc)
iges2soft.txt contains command line option information.

=====Use Polytrans file exchange utility:=====

Polytrans by Okino can read IGES files and write Softimage files. Check out their web site for more information: www.okino.com.

=====Use Phoenix Tools plug-in:=====

The best way to get objects correctly trimmed objects from Rhino into Softimage is:

  - Export the model to the Softimage IGES flavor.
  - From the File menu click Export Selected.
  - In the Save dialog box, in the Save as type box, select IGES.
  - In the IGES Export Options dialog box, select Softimage.

If it is a very large model, it is best to export your objects separately. Exporting objects separately makes it easier to sort in schematic view when you recombine the scene elements later. Exporting as separate objects makes the conversion process less complicated on import into Softimage, as each imported section is brought in under a parent null.

=====Open Softimage=====

  - Import the file: Tools > Import > Objects > PT_IgesImport.
  - Select the database from where you want to save the imported IGES file upon conversion to Softimage format.(It is a good idea to create a new Softimage directory specifically for the task of IGES importing.)
  - Accept Phoenix Tools Iges Import default settings. The model will be translated and then appear in Softimage.
  - Select all models [spacebar+a] and rotate -90 in the X axis: Model > Effect > FreezeÂ > Rotation.
  - Save scene/model to await merging into desired Softimage scene.
