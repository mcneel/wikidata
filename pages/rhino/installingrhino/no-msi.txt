====== NO MSI INSTALLER Available for Rhino 6 and later  ======

The Rhino installer executable **Rhino.exe** inspects your system to ensure that the correct versions of the .NET framework, .NET core framework, and Microsoft C runtimes are installed. It will download and install them as needed. It also installs four MSI files that are related to the Rhino product itself and ensures that compatible versions of the MSIs are installed.

The requirements for all the versions of prerequisites and compatible Rhino modules are neither published nor maintained anywhere outside the Rhino installer itself. //This makes it nearly impossible to install Rhino without the exe installer.//

Microsoft doesnâ€™t make it possible to ship commercial applications using the frameworks described above using an MSI. They did 15 years ago, but found that it was unreliable and support has since been discontinued for that installation method. SCCM and Intune both support exe installations. Please refer to the documentation for each to properly deploy Rhino.
