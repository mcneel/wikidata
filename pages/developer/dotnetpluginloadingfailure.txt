> **Summary:** //What to do when DotNET plug-ins fail to load//

Since Version 3, Rhino has supported DotNET plug-ins. Since Rhino 4 this implementation is very complete and robust. However, some problems remain. This page treats the known issues and possible solutions.

\\

=====Language setting issue=====

DotNET plug-ins failed to load on Windows versions with certain language packs (such as Turkish). A fix for this issue is available for Rhino4 SR1.

\\

=====Remote path issue=====

If a DotNET plug-in is not located on the local hard drive (i.e. if it is loaded over a network) it will not load. A fix for this issue is available for Rhino 4 SR1.

\\

=====General loading problems=====

If you're still running into problems, you can enable a hidden command in Rhino which creates a report on the loading process:

  - Close all Rhino instances.
  - Start a new instance of Rhino.
  - Run the command _TestDotNetMessages
  - You should see the following message:  <color blue> Rhino.NET plug-in manager debug messages enabled. You must restart Rhino for this effect to take place.</color>
  - Restart Rhino and attempt to load the plugi-n again.
  - Now, there will be information printed in the command line whenever a DotNET plugin is loaded.
  - Use the _TestDotNetMessages command again to disable DotNET loading reports.


Please send us the contents of your command history window.
