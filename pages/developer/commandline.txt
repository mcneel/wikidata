====== Running Rhino from the command line ======

> **Summary:** //Explains how to run Rhino from the Windows command line with the /runscript argument//

Sometimes, it would be really useful to run Rhino from the command prompt. Perhaps you are batch processing some files, or maybe you need to run Rhino from a render farm management system.  Rhino 4.0 provides the /runscript command line switch to allow you to do exactly this.  The format is:

rhino4.exe /runscript="//-command -secondCommand//"

For example, if you want to start Rhino with a file called hdri_test.3dm, render it with the built-in renderer, save the file and exit Rhino. Here's a magic command script:

"c:\program files\Rhinoceros 4.0\system\Rhino4.exe" /runscript="_SetCurrentRenderPlugIn RhinoRender //render //-saverenderwindowas test.jpg //closerenderwindow //-exit" hdri_test.3dm

====Command line options====
**/safemode**: Start in safe mode.

**/nosplash**: Suppress startup splash screen.

**/bigdump**: When Rhino crashes, include the full contents of memory in addition to call stack information. This can generate huge crash dumps -- as big as the amount of RAM Rhino is using when it crashes.

**/notemplate**: Start Rhino with a default model based on hard-coded defaults.

**/language**: Set the startup language. For example, to start in Spanish, pass /language=1034.

**/scheme**: Use a custom scheme. This is used by third party developers that include custom skins. 

**/runscript**: Run a script at startup.
