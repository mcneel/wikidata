=====Rhino Offline Installation and Validation=====
//Applies to Rhino 6, 7 and newer.//

The Rhino installer is responsible for making sure your Windows installation has everything it needs to run Rhino. This includes the .NET framework and Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime redistributable packages. Because many computers already have these packages, they are not embedded in the installer. They are downloaded as needed during installation.

In order to install offline, however, you need to make sure these packages are available.
====Downloading Windows Packages For Offline Installation ====
From a computer with internet access:
  - Download and install Microsoft Windows updates offline. This is a critical step. Skipping this may result in Rhino failing to install.
  - Here is a 3rd party tech site article on [[https://windowsreport.com/offline-update-windows-10/|Installing Windows Updates Offline]]. A google search may find more.

  - Copy the **redist** folder to the same location.
  - On the offline computer, run the **Bootstrapper.exe** file.

  * Follow the [[rhino:installingrhino:7|deployment instructions]].

=====Validating an offline installation=====
Rhino licenses must be validated before they can be used. For offline computers, you can perform license validation offline.

  - When you launch Rhino, you will be notified that Rhino is unable to connect to the validation server. {{ :zoo:validate01.png?direct&200 |}}
  - Click the button **"Get Validation Code Manually"**.
  - The following dialog box will appear. {{ :zoo:validate02.png?direct&200 |}} 
  - Write down the **License Key**, **Device Name**, and **Device ID** information that is presented.
  - Go to a system with Internet access.
  - In a web browser, go to https://www.rhino3d.com/validate.
  - Enter your **email address**, Rhino **license key**, **Device Name**, and **Device ID** information into the form. {{ :zoo:validate2.jpg?direct&200 |}}
  - If upgrading, you will also enter a license key for a previous version of Rhino.
  - Your validation code will be displayed. Print or save it to a text file. //This code needs to be used within 24-hours of generating it//.
  - Return to the offline system and pick **Continue** button.
  - Enter your validation code in the Validation Wizard and click Next.

Rhino will now be successfully validated offline.

**Note:** For network-wide deployment and using an offline LAN Zoo, the necessary data is presented when you try to add a license to that Zoo. For a Zoo-specific write-up of the preceding instructions, see https://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/rhinovalidateoffline#validating_offline
