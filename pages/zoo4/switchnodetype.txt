=====Question=====
To use the Zoo, does the user need to install Rhino as a workgroup node? Meaning, if he uses Rhino already as a standalone node and changes to using the Zoo, does he need to completely reinstall Rhino?

=====Answer=====
If the user is already running Rhino in standalone mode and then somebody installs a Zoo, then they can do one of two things.

  - From with in Rhino, select **Tools->License Manager->Workgroup Node**. This will switch Rhino's operating mode from standalone to workgroup (and vise versa). The change will take effect the next time they start Rhino.
  - From with in Rhino, run the **CheckInLicense** command. If they standalone CD-Key is not in the Zoo, then it will be added and the operating mode switched from standalone to workgroup.
