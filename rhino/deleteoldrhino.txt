=====Question=====
Can I delete older versions in "Add or Remove Programs" without causing problems?

=====Answer=====
The "Add or Remove Programs" entry in the Control Panel in Windows is reporting all Service Releases as an installed program, each using approx. 250MB of disk space. This is somewhat misleading. Windows reports the total as though all installed files are added on to the existing installation even though many if not all files are actually overwritten on install. Do **not** use the "Add or Remove Programs" to remove older Service Releases of Rhino 5.
