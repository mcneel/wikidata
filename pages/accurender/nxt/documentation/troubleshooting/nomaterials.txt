===== Material Assignments by Layer do not Appear =====

If you assign a material to an object's layer, but the object continues to render as if it does not have a material assignment (or as if it has a different material assignment) use the following procedure:

  - Select the offending object(s)
  - Click the "Remove Material from Objects" button on the nXt Material Tab
  - Repeat the rendering

The by-layer material assignment should now appear.

**Additional Notes**

  * Older models, or models created by 3rd party software, often contain objects or sub-objects whose material is listed as "Global" instead of "ByLayer".  The procedure above //must// be used on these objects before a layer assignment will be visible.
  * The system variable _CMATERIAL controls the default material for newly created objects.  It should be set to "ByLayer".
  * Using the AutoCAD commmand for removing materials from objects (located on the AutoCAD Materials Palette), will also work.
