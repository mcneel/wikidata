====== Rhino does not run due to .NET 4 Error ======
After installing the .NET Framework 4, programs, like Rhino that require it, still do not believe it is installed and refuse to run. 

==== This happens after installing:====
  * Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Full)
  * Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile
Both report the .NET Framework 4 installation was successful and it appears in the list of installed programs in Control Panel.

==== You may have tried:====
Rebooted and Reinstalled but nothing has worked.


==== Solution====
  - **Log in as the Administrator on the computer with FULL ADMINISTRATOR RIGHTS. Individuals may have some administrator rights. However, it is not the same.**
  - Use the clean-up procedure detailed in the  [[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx|.NET Framework Cleanup Tool User's Guide]].
  - After clean-up, install the [[http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851|Microsoft .NET Framework 4]] and .NET [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/zoodotnet|Framework 4.5]] for Zoo 6.

The Microsoft .NET Framework 4/4.5 web installer package downloads and installs the .NET Framework components required to run on the target machine architecture and OS. 

An Internet connection is required during the installation. .NET **Framework 4** is required to run and develop applications to target the **.NET Framework 4** for Zoo 5 and .NET **Framework 4.5** for Zoo 6.

This version of the .NET Framework runs side-by-side with the .NET Framework 3.5 and earlier versions, but performs an in-place update for the .NET Framework 4. 
==== Test ====
Copy this into Internet Explorer and it will report back the version of .NET.
