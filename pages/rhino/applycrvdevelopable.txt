To apply curves from a developed 2d pattern back to the 3d surface, follow these steps:


\\

| {{:legacy:en:apply2dCurves.png}}|   **1.** Create a developed surface from the 3d surface using UnrollSrf  **2.** Draw the 2d pattern on this surface to taste.  **3.** Use CreateUVCrv ( or in V3, under bonus tools CreateUVCrvOnSrf) to make UV curves from the developed surface including the added curves.  **4.** ApplyCrv all of the curves created by CreateUVCrv  back to the original surface.|
