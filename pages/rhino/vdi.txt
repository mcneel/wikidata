====== Does Rhino support VDI? ======

Rhino 8 supports a number of VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) systems:

  * Amazon AppStream
  * Amazon Workspaces,
  * Citrix XCenApp
  * Citrix XenDesktop
  * Cloudalize
  * Itopia
  * Nutanix Frame
  * Vagon.io

Rhino is officially not supported on AWS EC2, though you might be able to get it to run if you use Remote Desktop to access it. Getting good display performance over RDP is challenging, even with proper NVIDIA cards. We can't help get that working.
