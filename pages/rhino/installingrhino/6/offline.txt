======Offline Installation of Rhino 6======

The Rhino installer is responsible for making sure your Windows installation has everything it needs to run Rhino. This includes the .NET framework and Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime redistributable packages. Because many computers already have these packages, they are not embedded in the installer. They are downloaded as needed during installation.

In order to install offline, however, you need to make sure these packages are available.

====Downloading Packages For Offline Installation ====
From a computer with internet access:
  - Download the [[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-windows/6/latest|latest Rhino installer]].
  - Start the installer on the computer with Internet access

  - Click the **Download packages for offline installation** link.{{ :rhino:installingrhino:6:install_download_packages.png?200 |}}

Rhino will now download the necessary packages to your computer and will show a dialog box while this is in progress. {{ :rhino:installingrhino:6:install_downloading.png?200 |}}

When the download is completed, you will see a dialog box saying **Layout Completed Successfully** and containing further instructions. {{ :rhino:installingrhino:6:install_download_finished.png?200 |}}

You will now find a **Bootstrapper.exe** file and **redist** folder next to the installer file that you just ran.
