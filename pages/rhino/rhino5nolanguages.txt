====== Incomplete Rhino 5 Install without the Language Pack ======

> **Summary:** //Installing a new language into Rhino 5.//
> **Related installation help:** //[[installproblems|Troubleshooting Rhino 5 Installation]]//

=====Question=====
Are you missing templates, toolbars, or plug-ins? This is a symptom that the language pack was not installed.

=====Answer=====
This can be either an incomplete or botched install if you are installing from the CD. Or it can be an error in the install script if you are installing from an MSI script.

If you install Rhino with the MSI install script above, but forget the language pack line, you need to manually run the MSI for the language pack on your systems. It is also located on the Rhino 5 CD in the Installers folder.

To verify if the language support is installed, look for the localization, plug-ins, and UI folders here:
//C:\Users\<login>\AppData\Roaming\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0//. 

If these folders are missing or if you have already opened Rhino, you won't find toolbars, templates, and Help. To fix this, do the following:
     - Insert your installation DVD, or if you are installing from a downloaded file, follow these instructions to  [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/rhino5/manual_extract_from_file|uncompress the downloaded Rhino 5 EXE into a folder.]]
     - Run the MSI for the language pack.
     - Open Rhino and type **ToolbarReset**. 
     - Close Rhino and reopen. This deletes the scheme in the registry. Reopening will reset it with the missing components.
