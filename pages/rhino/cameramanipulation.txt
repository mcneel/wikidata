======Keyboard and Mouse Combinations======

>Keyboard and mouse combinations to get the camera where you want it



The **Camera** command (keyboard shortcut **F6**) will let you Show/Hide the camera in your viewports.

====Abbreviations:====
  * RMB = Right Mouse Button
  * MMW = Middle Mouse Wheel


=====Moving the camera=====

====Tumble around target====

RMB or arrow keys

  * To break a orthogonal view (such as your standard Top, Front, Right, etc.) and enter a tumble, use Ctrl + Shift + RMB.

====Pan moving camera and target====
{{:legacy:en:pan-wt.gif}}
Shift + RMB

  * In orthogonal views, RMB alone will do this.

====Pan with camera remaining stationary, target moving====
{{:legacy:en:pan.gif}}
Ctrl + Alt + RMB

====Tilt (Dutch)(Roll?) Camera - Revolve camera about axis====
{{:legacy:en:dutch.gif}}
Shift + Alt + RMB

  * In V4, doing this with the cursor at the edges of the viewport will constrain the rotation in 5 degree increments.

=====Zooming=====

====Zoom - Keeping target in the same plane====
 Note: The target will not stay in the exact location. It will stay in the same plane perpendicular to the camera. However, its position on that plane will change depending on where the cursor is located during the zoom.

MMW

CTRL + RMB

  * If you are using this method in a perspective viewport, you will find that as you zoom further and further in, you will eventually run into your target, which gives the appearance of not being able to zoom in any further. To correct this use [[rhino:placetarget|Place Target]].
