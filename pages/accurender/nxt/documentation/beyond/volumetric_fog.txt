====== Volumetric Fog ======

//Volumetric fog requires build 254 or above.  This effect requires the [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:pathtracer|Path Tracer]], it is not available in the standard engine.//

Volumetric fog allows the atmosphere surrounding your model to participate in the lighting calculation.  Effects such as "sun streaks" or "light beams" can be accurately modeled using this effect.  Tips on achieving both of these specific phenomena are discussed below.

**To enable volumetric fog:**

  * On the Advanced Lighting tab, click the Enable box in the Fog group.

After you enable fog a box will appear in your model.  This box controls the extent of the fog.  It can be stretched using grip points, scaled, and moved.

**The following settings are available:**

  * **Scattering** controls the probability of the light encountering a particle per one meter length.  Higher numbers produce denser fogs.  The default of 5% (0.05) is adequate for many uses.
  * **Scattering Direction** controls how the light is scattered.  Values > 0 produce forward scattering.  Values < 0 produce backward scattering, similar to reflection.  The default of 0.2 produces a pattern which resembles water droplets suspended in air.
  * **Absorption** is the probability of light being absorbed per one meter length.  Higher numbers produce darker fogs.  This is normally left at 0.0.
  * The **Color Swatch** allows you to change the scattering color, normally set to white.

**Tips for Producing Exterior "Sun Streaks"**

  * Create a [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:multi-channel|multi-channel rendering]] and place the sun on one channel and the sky on another.
  * Using the Channels dialog box, turn the sky down to 0.2.  (The particles in the air will act as your "sky". The standard sky model is not accurate when representing very "low" skies.)
  * Change the sun direction so your model is lit from behind.  Sun streaks will usually only be visible in the dark areas of your model.  Add [[accurender:nxt:documentation:basic:plants|trees]] or other shade producing objects.

**Tips for Producing Interior "Light Beams"**

  * //This effect often requires a long time to properly resolve.  It may be impractical for some scenes.//
  * Use low density fog.  Set Scattering to 0.005 as a start.
  * Use focused lighting, such as spot lights with narrow cones.
