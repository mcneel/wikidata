====== Rhino 7 SubD Tutorials ======

> **Summary:** Rhino 7 includes a new Sub-D Geometry Type to allow for more flexible modeling.  Rhino's SubDs are accurate and repeatable.  This allows our SubD to be converted to NURBS for fabrication.

Traditionally SubD objects are mesh-based and lend themselves well to more approximate types of modeling such as character modeling and creating smooth organic forms. Rhino SubD objects are, however, high precision spline-based surfaces and thus introduce a level of accuracy to the process of creating complex freeform shapes.

=====An Introduction to SubD in Rhino 7=====

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIbsNurVdb0|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:subd-phil_cook.png?direct&650|}}]]

The video starts by examining SubD surfaces and how these compare to NURBS before moving on to look at some examples of how and why SubD can be used alongside the traditional NURBS workflow in Rhino. Phil Cook from [[https://simplyrhino.co.uk/|SimplyRhino]] takes a look at SubD, or Subdivision Surface Modelling, that is being developed for Rhino v7.(37 minutes) SimplyRhino is the most popular Rhino3D reseller in the UK, they offer expert training and support for Rhino and all key Rhino plugins.
