  * Most browsers have settings to prevent popup advertisements and may incorrectly confuse our open windows as advertisements. Disable all popup blockers.
  * Many search engine browser tool bars also have features to prevent popup advertisements, make sure these are turned off. If you have multiple browser tool bar programs installed with this feature, make sure to disable popup blocking feature for EVERY installed toolbar.

This application generates numerous documents (like certificates and reports) using the Adobe Acrobat PDF format.
  * Make sure you have most recent PDF reader software loaded on your computer, by default PDF software is loaded on most computers. Visit the adobe website to update.
  * If you have multiple browsers installed on your computer, or loaded a new browser on top of an older browser, it's possible one or more of these browsers need to PDF reader software loaded into it.
 
==== Problems playing videos? ====
This application uses a video player based either HTML5 or Adobe Flash to play videos. This is typical for applications like this. The player will choose between HTML5 or Adobe Flash based on your browser. Older browsers that do not support HTML5 will need Adobe Flash. In this case the video player will automatically make sure the correct version of Adobe Flash is available. If the application can't automatically access Flash because of security settings, you may need to manually visit the adobe website to update.
 
==== Using a Thin Client, Dumb Terminal or Terminal Emulator? ====
This application is compatible with most Thin Clients, if the browsers on those devices are truly compatible with those listed as recommended above. Make sure when configuring Terminal Server software all such settings mimic the above listed recommendations. Make sure ample memory is allocated to each user and user session management capabilities are enabled.
 
==== Using a Proxy Server? ====
If using a proxy server, make sure browser session data is not cached, which is a standard setting. This will allow multiple users on multiple devices to access this application simultaneously without your network equipment mixing up the users.
 
==== Login Lockout ====
When logging in, if incorrect access information has been repeatedly entered too many times, this application will prevent further login attempts within a limited timeframe. If the timeframe as expired and you still can't login, then there's some browser setting or a browser add-in that's preventing the test.com application to clear the settings on your computer. You will need to clear your Internet cached history. For most browsers open your browser's Tools menu then choose Internet Options, clear history and cookies.
 
==== Problems using a new browser? ====
Often when software companies release newer versions of their browsers, these browsers have minor compatibility problems. The fix, most of these browsers offer a 'Compatibility View' or 'Compatibility View' feature. Turn it on to see if that resolves the problem.
