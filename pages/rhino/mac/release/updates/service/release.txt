====== Are there Service Releases or Updates on the way? ======
> **Summary:** //After Rhino 5 for Mac is released, will there be Service Releases or Updates?//

Yes.  In fact, Rhino 5 for Mac updates will include both bug fixes as well as new features.  When [[http://www.rhino3d.com/mac-feature-compare|comparing Rhino 5 for Mac and Rhino 5 for Windows]], you will notice that Rhino 5 for Mac lacks some of the features of Rhino 5 for Windows.  Features like Layouts and Worksessions, while not included in the initial release, are planned for subsequent updates.  Those who have purchased Rhino 5 for Mac will receive these updates at **no additional cost**.

===== Update Timeline for 5.0 Release Cycle =====
