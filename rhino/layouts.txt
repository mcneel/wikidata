====== Introduction to Rhino 4 Page (Sheet) Layouts ======

**This page is for the older version of Rhino. If you are using Rhino 5, please go to the Updated Rhino 5 Layouts page: 
[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/layouts5| Rhino 5 Layouts Tutorials]]**

The Page (Sheet) Layout is used to arrange, annotate and plot the model. Layout viewports are designed to do the following:

      * Arrange several views of the model at different orientations
      * Assign model scales to the detail viewport.
      * Add annotations like title blocks and general notes
      * Plot from this area 1=1, typically.
Before Page (Sheet) Layouts in Rhino 3, arranging multiple views of the model on a title block was done outside of Rhino with other CAD software.

This tutorial steps you through the setup of a model to plot from a Page (Sheet) Layout viewport. You can download these files and work along with the tutorial.
