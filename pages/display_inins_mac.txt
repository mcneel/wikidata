====== Exporting Rhino for Windows Display Modes for Mac ======

Display modes can be exported from **Rhino for Windows** and imported into **Rhino for Mac**. 
However, there is one step you may not be aware of. **Rhino for Windows** exports the INI in text format in **UTF-16-LE**. Programs on the Mac can not read this format. {{::windows.png?400|}}

After exporting the **INI** from **Rhino for Windows**, open in //Notepad// and save it as **UTF-8** or **ASCI**. 
Then send it to to your Mac computer and import as a display mode. Below are the detailed steps.

==== Export from Rhino for Windows ====
  - In **Rhino for Windows**, go to Options -> View -> Display Mode.
  - Highlight this display mode and pick **Export** button.

==== Text Editor in Windows (Option 1) ====
  - Open the INI that you exported in Windows **Notepad** application.
  - Pick File -> Save AS.
  - In the dialog, pick the format of **UTF-8** or **ASCI**.{{::mac_ini.png?400|}}
  - Change the name to reflect the format for identification keeping the //.INI// extension. (This is important for importing as a display mode.) {{::mac_naming_format.png?400|}}
  - Transfer the file to the Mac (email, shared drive or dropbox.)

==== Text Editor in Mac (Option 2) ====
  - On the Mac, you will need to download a Text Editor like [[https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit//|BBedit]] for Mac.
  - Open the INI that you exported in **BBedit** application.
  - Pick File -> Save AS.
  - In the dialog, pick the format of **UTF-8** or **ASCI**. Change the name to reflect the format for identification keeping the //.INI// extension.(This is important for importing as a display mode.) {{:bbedit.jpg?400|{{::mac_naming_format.png?400|}}}}
