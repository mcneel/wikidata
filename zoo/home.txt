======Zoo - License Manager======
[[zoo:home|{{:zoo:zoo_small.png|Zoo Home}}]]

=====Overview=====
The Zoo lets you share Rhino, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, and Bongo licenses (CD-Keys) among users on the same network workgroup. When these products are installed as the workgroup nodes instead of stand-alone, it works like this: 

  * When a workgroup node starts, it requests a license from the Zoo. 
  * An unused license is assigned to the node. 
  * When a node shuts down, the license is returned to the Zoo's license pool. 

** The Zoo is free!**

**[[http://download.rhino3d.com/Zoo/5.0/release/download/|Download Zoo 5]]**  for Rhino 5 (//Rhino 4, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, and Bongo not supported//).

**[[http://download.rhino3d.com/zoo/4.0/release/download/|Download Zoo 4.0]]** for Rhino 4, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, and Bongo (//Rhino 5 not supported//).

//Note: it is possible to have both Zoo 4.0 and Zoo 5 running on the same network, and even installed on the same server, without conflict.//
===== Features =====
  * **No extra costs** - Special versions of Rhino, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, or Bongo are not needed. 
  * **No special hardware needed** - The Zoo will run on any system in the same network workgroup. 
  * **No special software needed** - The Zoo will run on any Windows system, including Windows XP, Vista, or 7, and Windows Server 2000, 2003 and 2008 systems.
  * **Simple setup** - Install the Zoo on any system in the workgroup and type the license keys into the Zoo instead of the individual systems. 
  * **Check out** - License keys can be checked out so laptop users can disconnect from the network. The key can be checked in again when the laptop is reconnected to the network. 
  * **Robust** - Workgroup nodes will keep working even if the network connection or server is down.
  * **Routable** - The Zoo works on both single-segments networks, or networks where systems are separated by routers. 
  * **Mixed environment** - A mixture of Workgroup Nodes and Standalone Nodes on the same Windows Domain or Workgroup is supported. 
  * **Runs as a service** - If you reboot the system with the Zoo, the Zoo will automatically start up. 

** What's New in Zoo 5?**

Zoo 5 is a brand new version of the Zoo. Completely rewritten, Zoo 5 provides a number of new features not found in prior Zoo versions, including:
  * **Standard Internet Protocol Support** - Clients communicate with Zoo 5 using HTTP (Port 80) protocol. This makes it much easier for system administrators to route Zoo requests on complex networks or even over the Internet.
  * **Firewall Friendly** - Zoo 5 requires the client to periodically check with the server, but never initiates connections back to the client. Administrators no longer need to open firewall ports on client machines.
  * **Limited License Check Out** - Prior Zoo version allows for license check out to support laptop users or for business travel. But there was no limit to the check out duration. Zoo 5 allows the administrator to specify the license check out duration.
  * **3rd Party Plug-in Support** - Prior Zoo version only maintained licenses for McNeel product (e.g. Rhino. Flamingo, Bongo, Brazil, and Penguin). Zoo 5 allows 3rd party plug-in developers to add support for their products to the Zoo.
