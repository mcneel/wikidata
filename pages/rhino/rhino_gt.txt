**[[https://www.construct3dconf.com/|Construct3D 2018]]** is a 3D printing, digital fabrication conference, and expo focused on academic use, best practices, and professional development opportunities for faculty, staff, and students. 

The **[[https://construct3d2018.sched.com/event/G4eK/rhino-for-educators-workshop|Rhino for Educators Workshop]]** is a comprehensive, one-day introductory class, you will learn the basics of creating and editing accurate 3-D models. This fast-moving class covers how to start using Rhino to develop models for both rendering and digital fabrication. The day will start with an introduction and progress rapidly to more advanced surfacing commands and preparing models for 3D printing. This class is designed to be "hand on." However, feel free to join us even if you do not have a computer.
