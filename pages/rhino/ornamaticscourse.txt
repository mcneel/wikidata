====== Ornamatics Course at TUDelft ======

> **Summary:** //The presentation and resulting scripts/plug-ins made for the Ornamatics course at the [[http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/|architecture facultiet]] at the [[http://www.tudelft.nl|TUDelft]] .//

\\

===== The course=====

The object of this course was to design and develop shape and pattern based ornaments in conjunction with rapid prototyping (3-D printing and milling).

This wiki page contains the scripts and plug-ins which I wrote as a result, as well as the presentations (*.ppt) format. Unfortunately there is no record of the presentation itself.

\\

The plug-ins and scripts on this page are provided as-is without any guarantee. These were written to do a specific task in a small amount of time. I did not put too much time into error trapping and UI.

\\

=====Shape=====

The shape part of the exercise was aimed at designing a column fit for 3-D printing. I tried to mimic a tree's root structure (upside down), which maximized internal intersections (for stability and structural integrity) while minimizing sharp bends (for torque forces). Interestingly, my initial approach which set out to duplicate a natural root structure did not perform well and I had to create another, far more abstract branching algorithm.

=====Pattern=====

The pattern part of the exercise was aimed at designing a 60*40 cm tile fit for 3-axis milling. I wanted to impose two conflicting patterns on the same tile, each of which would be dominant from a different distance.
