===== Question =====
I just downloaded the openNURBS 5.0 toolkit (22-Nov-2011), and I noticed that the download does not include a Visual Studio 2008 solution (.vcproj and .sln files). Are you only supporting Visual Studio 2010? Are there any known issues using Visual Studio 2008?

===== Answer =====
The openNURBS 5.0 toolkit has been successfully used in C++ projects built with both Visual Studio 2005 and 2010. We do not have any experience with Visual Studio 2008, so we cannot report on any issues with this development tool.

We have, though, successfully built the openNURBS 5.0 toolkit using Visual Studio 2008. If you need a Visual Studio 2008 solution, you can download it below.
