====== Sub-surface Scattering ======

//Sub-surface scattering requires build 254 or above.  The [[accurender:nxt:documentation:beyond:pathtracer|Path Tracer]] is required for this effect.//

Sub-surface scattering is an advanced material property found only in the Advanced Material Editor on the Transparency Page.  Using this effect, light is permitted to penetrate the surface of your object and scatter in any direction.  Many translucent materials can be modeled using this effect.  Certain surfaces, such as stone or skin can be realistically softened by allowing the light to penetrate a short distance.


**The following settings are available:**

  * **Scattering** controls the probability of the light encountering a particle per unit length.  Units can be centimeters (default), meters, or millimeters. Higher numbers produce more scattering.  
  * **Scattering Direction** controls how the light is scattered.  Values > 0 produce forward scattering.  Values < 0 produce backward scattering, similar to reflection.  The default of 0.0 produces an isotropic scattering pattern which is adequate for many materials.
  * **Absorption** is the probability of light being absorbed per unit length.  Higher numbers produce darker materials.

**Additional notes:**

  * The material must have some transparency in order for sub-surface scattering to take place.
  * This is a volumetric effect.  The objects with this material attached must be solid or space enclosing for this to work properly.  Thin objects should be tagged using Object Properties.  Objects tagged as thin can use standard translucency, but will not be able affected by the Sub-surface scattering properties.
