> **Summary:** //Frequently ask questions regarding the Rhino C++ SDK.//

=====What development tools do I need to create plug-ins using the Rhino C++ SDK?=====
  * To create plug-ins for Rhino 5 64-bit, you will need Microsoft Visual C++ 2010.
  * To create plug-ins for Rhino 5 32-bit, you will need Microsoft Visual C++ 2005.
  * To create plug-ins for Rhino 4.0, you will need Microsoft Visual C++ 2005.

**Note:** You cannot create plug-ins for Rhino using the free Express Editions of Microsoft Visual C++, as they do not come with the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) libraries.

=====Can I use Visual C++ 2012, 2013 or 2015 to build C++ plug-ins for Rhino?=====

No, you must use the versions of Microsoft Visual C++ noted above. Microsoft Visual C++ 2012, 2013, and 2015 come with a newer version of C-Runtime and MFC, which is incompatible to the version used by Rhino. You must link your plug-in project with the same version of the C-Runtime and MFC libraries as Rhino.

=====Can I use Windows 8 as a platform for building plug-ins for Rhino?=====
Visual C++ 2010 installs and operates as expected on Windows 8. But, Visual C++ 2005 will not install on Windows 8. Thus, although it is possible create plug-ins for Rhino 5 64-bit on Windows 8, it is not possible to build plug-ins for Rhino 5 32-bit or Rhino 4.0. 

It might be possible to run a Visual C++ 2005-compatible operating system on Windows 8 with a virtualization product such as [[http://www.vmware.com/|VMware]]. This would make it possible to build plug-ins for Rhino 5 32-bit or Rhino 4.0.

=====What documentation is available for developing plug-ins?=====
HTML help documentation, included with the Rhino SDK, provides detailed information on SDK classes and their hierarchy. Also, there is a substantial amount of information in the Rhino C++ [[developer:sdksamples:knowledgebasecpp|SDK Knowledge Base]]. And, the Rhino C++ [[https://github.com/mcneel/Rhino5Samples_CPP|SDK Samples]] contain many useful sample plug-in projects, demonstrating a variety of capabilities.

=====Is developer training available for the Rhino SDK?=====
Rhino SDK training is available in either Seattle, Washington (US) or Barcelona, Spain. Our SDK training is much like consulting in that it is customized for the audience. We do not follow a preset agenda and we do not sit in a classroom and lecture. It should be mentioned that very few of our third party developers have had SDK training, which is hopefully testament to the SDK and our developer support. Those who do end up coming here for training have already spent time with the SDK. Thus, we spend our time addressing specific questions and problems.

=====What products have been developed with the Rhino SDK?=====
The products developed for Rhino fall into a variety of categories, including analysis, CAM, jewelry, marine, reverse engineering, rendering, and many others. You can check out what is available for Rhino on our [[http://www.rhino3d.com/resources/|Related Products and Services]] page.
