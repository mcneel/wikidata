====== Introduction to Rhino 5 Layouts ======


The Layout is used to arrange, annotate and plot the model. Layouts are designed to do the following:

      * Arrange views of the model, called details, at different scales and orientations.
      * Add annotations like title blocks and general notes to the layout
      * Assign scales to the details and plot the layout 1=1
      * Create text, dimensions in the details or on the layout
      * Use Annotation Scaling for text, dimensions and hatch
      * Control layer visibility and color per detail
      * Plot one, some or all the layouts to a plotter, printer or PDF.

Before Layouts in Rhino 3, arranging multiple views of the model on a title block was done outside of Rhino with other CAD software. Rhino 4 added the Layout space, and Rhino 5 improves it.

This tutorial steps you through the setup of a model to plot from a Sheet Layout viewport. You can download these files and work along with the tutorial.

In this tutorial, we will:
  - Use the Layout feature to create a plot sheet with details and title block. 
  - Set the scale to the details and add text and dimensions that are sized correctly to the detail. Use layer visibility per detail and set layer color per detail.
  - Annotate the plot sheet with title block, notes and other objects that are not directly related to the model. 
  - Assign print width, print color to objects, and enable the Print Preview mode. 
  - Plot the layout 1:1 or full size to a PDF.
