====== Visual Studio 2010 Professional with MSDN ======
====Why Visual Studio 2010?====
Rhino 5 links with MFC. Visual C++ 2010 Express does not come with MFC, so you won't be able to link your plug-in.

You need [[http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/professional|Visual Studio 2010 Professional]] to get MFC.

====Why MSDN?====
If you already have Visual Studio 2005, then this isn't a requirement.

If you //do not// have Visual Studio 2005, //and// you want to compile 32-bit plug-ins, you need the MSDN (not Essentials) subscription to download and install the 2005 compiler tools. 

For backward compatiblity with Rhino 4, 32-bit plug-ins compile and link with Visual Studio 2005, the 2005 Platform SDK, and the 2005 MFC.
