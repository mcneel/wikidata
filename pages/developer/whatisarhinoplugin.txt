=====What is a Rhino plug-in?=====

  * A Rhino plug-in is a software module that extends the functionality of Rhino by adding commands, features, or capabilities.
  * A Rhino plug-in is a Windows Dynamic Link Library, or DLL.
    * A Rhino plug-in built with the [[developer:cplusplusplugins|Rhino C++ SDK]] is a regular DLL using shared MFC DLL.
    * A Rhino plug-in built with the [[developer:dotnetplugins|Rhino .NET SDK]], or the [[developer:rhinocommon|RhinoCommon SDK]], is a .NET assembly.
  * Examples of Rhino plug-ins include [[http://bongo3d.ning.com|Bongo]], [[http://brazil.mcneel.com|Brazil]], [[http://nxt.flamingo3d.com|Flamingo nXt]], and [[http://www.penguin3d.com|Penguin]].

=====What types of plug-ins are supported?=====

Rhino supports five different types of plug-ins.

  - **General Utility**. A general purpose plug-in that can contain one or more commands.
  - **File Import**. A plug-in that imports data from other file formats into Rhino. A single File Import plug-in can support more that one file type.
  - **File Export**. A plug-in that exports data from Rhino to other file formats. A single File Export plug-in can support more than one file type.
  - **Custom Rendering**. A plug-in that applies materials, textures, and lights to a scene to produce rendered images.
  - **3-D Digitizing**. A plug-in that interfaces with 3-D digitizing devices, such as those manufactured by MicroScribe, Faro, and Romer.

**Note:** //File Import, File Export, Custom Rendering and 3-D Digitizing plug-ins are all specialized enhancements to the General Utility plug-in. Thus, all plug-in types can contain one or more commands.//

=====What is required to build a plug-in?=====

====C++====
  * Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 for Rhino 5 64-bit.
  * Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 for Rhino 5 32-bit and Rhino 4.0.
====.NET====
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 for Rhino 5, either C# or Visual Basic (VB.NET). **Note:** //Rhino 5 requires that .NET plug-ins target the .NET 4.0 Framework.//
  * Either Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2005 for Rhino 4.0, either C# or Visual Basic (VB.NET). **Note:** //Rhino 4.0 requires that .NET plug-ins target the .NET 2.0 Framework.//



=====How to get development support?=====

  * The getting started samples, included with the SDK, demonstrate plug-in basics.
  * The HTML help documentation, included with the SDK, provides information on SDK classes and their hierarchy.
  * The Rhino plug-ins newsgroup, either the news reader or the web browser version, allows you to post questions to and read responses from other plug-in developers.
  * Use the web browser version to search the Rhino plug-ins newsgroup archive for previously posted questions or samples.
  * Email developer support directly.
  * Frequent this location, the Rhino Developer Resources wiki site.
