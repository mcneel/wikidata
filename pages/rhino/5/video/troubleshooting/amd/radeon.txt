=====Display Troubleshooting: ATI Radeon =====

These instructions are for computers that have **AMD/ATI Radeon** graphics hardware.\\

**To complete these instructions you must know:**
  - The card manufacturer.  This page is for ATI Technologies cards
  - The video card model. These recommendations are for Radeon cards.
  - The operating system of the computer. [[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-operating-system|Which Operating System?]]

If you are not sure of any of these, please go to our **[[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:failure|Video Troubleshooting Section]]** for additional instructions.

If you are running a **Radeon** card, the latest drivers are buggy. Because of this, you have two choices to proceed.
  - Radeon cards cannot hide edges properly and have anti-aliasing on at the same time. If the objects do not look solid, but transparent, turn-off anti-aliasing in Rhino.  This will get the model to shade properly.
  - A second option is to download and install the drivers from **January 2014**. After this date we have been seeing many problems.  See below for instructions:

> **Warning!**\\ It is possible to install the **//wrong driver//** for your graphics card and operating system. This will cause many problems. Be //very sure// you are downloading and installing the **//correct driver//** for your system.

> Before updating your video drivers we recommend creating a system restore point on your computer in the changes need to be rolled back.  [[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-restore-faq#1TC=windows-7|Instructions to make a system restore point]]

**Update your video driver:**
  - Close Rhino.
  - Get updated video drivers.
    - **Desktop**: [[http://support.amd.com/en-us/download|Go to the AMD site.]] 
    -**Laptop**: Get updated drivers from the laptop maker's Web site. 
    -**Mac**: Get Bootcamp updates come from [[http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/|Apple.]]
  - Select the **graphics card** make and model and the **Windows operating system** you're using.
  - On the right side of the page, click on the option: "Download Previous Drivers & Software".
  - **Download** the suggested driver **installer**. For Radeon these are drivers from December 2013 or January 2014. For most people this will be driver 13.12.
  - **Run** the installer.
  - **Restart** your computer if prompted to do so.
  - **Open Rhino** to test if your issue has been fixed.
