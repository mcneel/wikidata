For the past year there have been several reports coming in about crashes in the video drivers from users who have specific NVIDIA Quadro video cards. Trying to isolate the problem to a level where Rhino developers could come up with some kind of workaround or fix has proven to be very difficult and elusive. 

The bottom line is that this problem is happening down inside the video driver, and although it *could* be caused by something Rhino is doing, the drivers should still not crash. Because of this, the possibility of fixing this in Rhino extremely difficult, or possibly impossible at this point.

This situation concerns us since work can be lost due to the crash and forced shutdown of Rhino(s). Some crashes seem to occur without Rhino running â€¦ just running web browsers and viewing video crashed the system at other times. But the combination of both Rhino and browser(s) seemed to speed up the frequency of crashes.

===== Random crashing with NVIDIA cards - NVIDIA Threaded Optimization setting =====

Many users are reporting random crashes with updated NVIDIA drivers.  There is a setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel that seems to help these problems.
