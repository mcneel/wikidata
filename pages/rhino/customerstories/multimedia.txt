I use Rhino for illustration projects, usually editorial illustration, but also for some commercial projects. Other software used for rendering and post processing include Carrara, PhotoShop. 

Sometimes I use Rhino as a foundation for traditional illustration (kind of like building a model to work from). For instance, I did a Christmas card with Santa riding in his sleigh. I did the sleigh in Rhino. I rotated the sleigh to fit into my art. Final art looked like an oil painting but was actually painted on the computer.
