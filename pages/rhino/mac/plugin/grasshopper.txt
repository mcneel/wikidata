====== Will Grasshopper 1 for Windows run in Rhino 5 for Mac? ======
> **Summary:** //No, but keep reading//

Plugins written for Rhino for Windows can not be used in Rhino for Mac.  This means that the Grasshopper plugin for Rhino for Windows cannot be used in Rhino for Mac.  That said...


There is an incomplete, "Work In Progress" implementation of Grasshopper 1 for Mac included in the RhinoWIP - Work In Progress (WIP) builds.  It is not production ready.  Since it is incomplete, the command name is "ExplicitHistory."

Grasshopper will not be included as part of Rhino 5 for Mac product life cycle.  Grasshopper 1 will be part of the Rhino 6 for Mac shared codebase, so Grasshopper 1 will eventually be included in Rhino 6 for Mac (if all goes according to plan).  After Rhino 6 for Windows is released, then Rhino 6 for Mac will shift to the shared version 6 codebase.  There is no estimate of when this work will be completed.


Anyone that owns a Rhino 5 for Mac license can participate in the Rhino WIP.  Check out...
