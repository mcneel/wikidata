=====Video Troubleshooting: Intel graphics=====

The Intel HD series of graphics cards has been among the least well performing cards we've seen. Some advanced display features appear to work on the 5000 series but earlier models are notorious for being inadequate to support the full display feature set in Rhino 5. You may already find that 'advanced hardware acceleration' is turned off in your OpenGL options within Rhino. This is done when we detect a graphics card that is not capable of working well but you can also disable it directly if needed. You should still be able to model but without the added graphics features such as shadows in the rendered display mode, texture display and anti-aliasing of wireframes.
