====== How was the video texure in the Walkby video done? ======

The video was done by David Rutten and he describes it this way:

I have to admit the animation isn't a 100% bongo. Here's how it was done:

First I set up the camera animation (using normal bongo steps)

Then I dissected a few seconds of the *.avi and saved all the frames as a
sequence of *.bmp files in a folder.

Then I wrote a small script that loaded one of the files from the sequence
as a texture in a material, called the bongo command to enter the next frame,
and saved the viewport to the disk.

The 'motion' is bongo, but the 'motion picture' is scripted.
