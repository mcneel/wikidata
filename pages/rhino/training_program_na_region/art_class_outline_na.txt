==== Goal: ====
This course will concentrate on how to teach Rhino.
How to make users more successful in a short time and without the pain of trial and error.
We will not cover in detail each part of Rhino, still the Level I and II guides will be the main reference.

==== Content: ====
The following is a list of topics that will be discussed during the course.
  * A welcome from McNeel North America
  * ART and ARTC requirements
  * New Rhino licensing tools
  * Level I and II basic courses
  * One on one training versus class training. Getting to know your pupils.
  * Class setup (windows / Mac)
  * Level I training: the most important one. A good start for an excellent user.
  * Why Rhino. Where the program sits in a project’s workflow.
  * Interface basics for the end user.
  * Precision modeling.
  * Making good curves.
  * More complex Curve handling.
  * Keeping your project under control: layers organizations and templates.
  * Surfaces in Rhino.
  * “Solids” how to use in a NURBS environment.
  * Surfacing tools. Which ones and in what sequence.
  * Meshing for visualization versus meshing for Rapid Prototyping.
  * Present a Helpful Level I course: Make simple but controlled objects.
  * Boolean explained. What could go wrong.
  * NetworkSrf a close look and caveat.
  * Surfacing in depth (Level II). Comparing different techniques.
  * The Approach to Modeling: How do objects made with different techniques compare? Advanced ways to analyze objects.
  * Fillets
  * Annotations and Layouts
  * Section Tools: Clipping Sections and Clipping Drawings
  * UDT
  * Implicit History
  * From Implicit to Explicit History aka Grasshopper
  * While we do not require our ARTs to have a specific knowledge in Grasshopper or any other programming language, it would be good to provide the end users a minimal information about what Grasshopper is.
