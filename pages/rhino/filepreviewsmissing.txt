====== Previews of Rhino files missing in Windows Explorer ======
> **Summary:** //How to make sure the Rhino thumbnail viewer is registered in Windows//

If you do not see preview thumbnails of Rhino (3dm files) in Windows Explorer, it may be that the RhinoHandlers.dll is not correctly registered with Windows. To register the dll, you'll need to have Administrator privileges in Windows. You can, from an 'elevated'command prompt (Run as Administrator), paste the following 

**regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System\RhinoHandlers.dll"**

and hit Enter. 

This process can be automated - download and unzip this file: {{:rhino:fixshellext.zip|}} to the desktop. Right click on the resulting .bat file and choose "Run as Administrator".
