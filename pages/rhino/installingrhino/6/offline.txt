======Offline Installation of Rhino 6======

The Rhino installer is responsible for making sure your Windows installation has everything it needs to run Rhino. This includes the .NET framework and Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime redistributable packages. Because many computers already have these packages, they are not embedded in the installer. They are downloaded as needed during installation.

In order to install offline, however, you need to make sure these packages are available.

====Downloading Packages For Offline Installation ====

1. Download the [[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-windows/6/latest|latest Rhino installer]].
1. Start the installer on a computer with Internet access
1. Click the **Gear icon** next to the Install Now button.
1. Click the **Download packages for offline installation** link.

====Deploying====
This process created a folder named **redist** next to the installer. It also downloaded the offline packages into that folder. Ensure that the **redist** folder is copied to the same location as the installer before deployment.
