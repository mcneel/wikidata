**[[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202790|Utility Rete]]** runs on a **Rhino for Mac** workstation. The utility provides several useful network diagnostics to troubleshoot connectivity issues between Rhino for Mac workstations and Zoo servers.

Use **[[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204014|Spotlight]]** on your Mac to find and open the Network Utility.

  - Click the **Search** icon in upper-right corner of the menu bar, or press the **Command** key + **Space** bar.
  - Type **Network Utility** to search.
  - Double-click **Network Utility** to run.

>**Note:** With the release of macOS Big Sur, Apple chose to discontinue this application. However, you can still access many of its most useful features using **[[https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-terminal-as-network-utility-replacement/|Terminal]]**.

  
=====Diagnostics=====
The Network Utility provides these useful network tests:

1. **Ping:** The ping diagnostics utility is the primary TCP/IP tool used to troubleshoot connectivity, reachability, and name resolution. Ping verifies IP-level connectivity to another TCP/IP computer by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages. Receipts of corresponding Echo Reply messages are displayed, along with round-trip times.

2. **Lookup:** The DNS Lookup diagnostic utility displays information that you can use to diagnose Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure.

3.  **Traceroute:** The Trace Route diagnostic utility determines the route taken to a destination by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo packets with varying IP Time-To-Live (TTL) values to the destination. Each router along the path is required to decrement the TTL on a packet by at least 1 before forwarding it, so the TTL is effectively a hop count. When the TTL on a packet reaches 0, the router should send an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source computer.

4. **Port Scan:** The Port Scan test scans for open TCP ports. In the case of the Zoo, you will want to scane for for TCP Port 80.

//If this test fails, then make sure the Zoo server service is running. You can do this by using either ZooAdmin.exe or the Services applet in Control Panel. Also, make sure __[[zoo:window7firewall|TCP Port 80 is open on any firewall software]],__ for both incoming and outgoing traffic, running on the Zoo system.//
