====== Can I Use PanelingTools? (Rhino for Mac) ======
> **Summary:** //Does the plug-in PanelingTools exist for Rhino for Mac?//

Yes. PanelingTools plug-in is **not** part of the released Rhino 5 for Mac, but it is available as part of the [[http://www.rhino3d.com/go/download/rhino-for-mac/wip/latest|Rhino for Mac WIP]]. If you own a Rhino for Mac license, then you need to download and install the Rhino for Mac WIP to access PanelingTools. 

Please note that the Rhino for Mac WIP is a Work-In-Progress, which means it includes the latest features and development, but it also means that there may be instability and bugs. We release new WIPs frequently as we add features and fix bugs. 

**Note:** In the WIP, there is no PanelingTools menu and the commands are available through the command line only. Type **pt** to see all the PanelingTools commands in the AutoComplete list.
