If Rhino obtains a licenses from a LAN Zoo, it will "ping" that Zoo every 5 minutes to let the LAN Zoo know it's still alive.
  * The LAN Zoo never checks for a key...
  * Rhino gets a key from the LAN Zoo, and tells the LAN Zoo it's still using it
  * Communication is //always// initiated from Rhino. The LAN Zoo will never initiate a conversation with Rhino.
