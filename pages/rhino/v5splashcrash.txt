======V5 Crashes in Splash and About======
Some HP notebook and laptop computers use a fingerprint scanning product developed by DigitalPersona that causes Rhino 5 to crash when using the Splash and About tool. This same tool causes button tooltip problems on flyout toolbars on Rhino 4.0.

In the V4 case we got on 21-Jan-2011 was a "HP TouchSmart tm2-2012tx". It has **HP SimplePass Identity Protection** installed that installs applications from DigitalPersona. The application causes the problem is **C:\Program Files (x86)\DigitalPersona\Bin\DPAgent.exe**. To solve the problem, turn the **DpAgent.exe *32** off from Windows Task Manager and rename it with a different name to prevent it running automatically when Windows starts.
