======RhinoMobile - HelloRhinoMobile======

**Mac Instructions**
  - In Xamarin Studio, open the //HelloRhinoMobile// solution.
  - Right-click the //HelloRhino.Touch// project and select //Set As Startup Project// from the drop-down menu.  This makes //HelloRhino.Touch// the active project for the build.  (//HelloRhino.Touch// is the iOS target project.  The //.Touch// suffix is a naming convention from Mono that conjures Cocoa//Touch// - the iOS library.  It is also a convention that avoids namespace collisions).  
  - Verify that the build is set to //Debug// and the device to //iOS Simulator > iPhone iOS 7//.  Click the //Play/Run// button.
  - [[http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/beginning_a_xamarin_trial|Start a Xamarin Trial]].  The Xamarin Starter edition allows you to unlock a 30-day trial of the full Business Edition, which will be necessary for building and using RhinoMobile.  You will need to create a Xamarin Login.  If you are unable to start a trial after creating a login, don't worry, Xamarin Studio will prompt you to when you try to build RhinoMobile projects.
  - Exit and restart Xamarin Studio.
  - From the Xamarin Studio Home Screen, re-open //HelloRhinoMobile// solution.
  - Verify that Xamarin Studio's full edition has been activated. Navigate to //Xamarin Studio > About Xamarin Studio > Show Details//.  Scroll down and make sure the //Xamarin.iOS// and //Xamarin.Android// are set to //Trial Edition//.  Close the //About Xamarin Studio// window.
  - Click the //Play/Run// button again.  This time the Build should succeed without errors.  After uploading the app bundle to the Simulator, you should see the following:
  - When you done playing around with the HelloRhino example on the iOS Simulator, click the //Stop// button in Xamarin Studio to stop the Debug session.
  - Now let's build and run the Android version.  Right-click the //HelloRhino.Droid// project and select //Set As Startup Project// from the drop-down menu.  As expected, this makes the Android project the default project for the build.  (Much like .Touch, .Droid is a Mono naming convention that avoids namespace collisions and denotes the Android target project).
  - Verify that the build is set to //Debug//.  The time, the device selection drop-down should be disabled.  This is because you don't have an Emulator setup, so let's do that now.
  - Click the //Play/Run// button to start the //HelloRhino.Droid// debug build.
