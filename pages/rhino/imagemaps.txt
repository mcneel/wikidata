===== To create an e-map for Rhino:=====

Choose the image for your e-map and load it into an image editor like Photoshop.  Crop it square. In PS there is a distortion filter called "spherize", other programs will have something similar.  Spherize the image (in PS at 100%).  Optionally, use the ellipse selection tool with Shift and select corner to corner to create a circle corresponding with the sphere; invert the selection and delete the corners outside the sphere image. Use Save for Web and save the image at 256 x 256 pixels, in PNG or JPG format.  Place it in your e-map folder (your path may be different):

C:\Program Files\[[rhino:rhinoceros|RhinoCeros]] 4.0(or 3.0 or 4.0 beta)\English\Environment Maps
