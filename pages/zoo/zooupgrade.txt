====== Upgrading a Zoo Server ======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Upgrading a Zoo server.//

If you are running an older version of the LAN Zoo, you will need to upgrade to **LAN Zoo 7** or the [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino_accounts/home|Cloud Zoo]] in order to support Rhino 7. 

//Consider migrating to the [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino_accounts/home|Cloud Zoo]] instead...//
===== Download and Install =====
  * [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/zoo/7/latest|Download the LAN Zoo 7 here...]]

  * Install where in that same local as your current LAN Zoo

  * Note: [[zoo:zoodotnet|Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 is required]]



===== FYI =====
  * Upon installation, Zoo 7 replaces your older Zoo.  

  * Users running Rhino at the time of installation will not be affected.

  * The installation takes about 15 seconds. During that time, users will not be able to get a license from the Zoo.
