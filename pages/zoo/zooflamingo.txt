======Flamingo nXt 3.0 and the Zoo======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses how to use Flamingo nXt with Zoo//

[[http://nxt.flamingo3d.com/|Flamingo nXt 3.0]] can be used with either Rhino 4.0 or Rhino 5. Because of this, Flamingo nXt network licenses can be served by either [[zoo4:home|Zoo 4.0]], Rhino 4.0's network license manager, or [[zoo:home|Zoo 6]], Rhino 5's network license manager.

=====More information=====
Upon initial installation, Flamingo nXt is configured to use a [[zoo4:home|Zoo 4.0]] server for network licensing. 

To reconfigure [[http://nxt.flamingo3d.com/|Flamingo nXt]] to use a [[zoo:home|Zoo 6]] server for network licensing, you need to run a utility program.

In Explorer on the Rhino workstation, navigate to the following folder:

====64-bit Windows====
<code>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\McNeel Shared\License Manager
</code>

====32-bit Windows====
<code>
C:\Program Files\Common Files\McNeel Shared\License Manager
</code>

To configure [[http://nxt.flamingo3d.com/|Flamingo nXt]] to use a [[zoo:home|Zoo 6]] server, run the **RegRhinoLM5.exe** utility.

To configure [[http://nxt.flamingo3d.com/|Flamingo nXt]] to use a [[zoo4:home|Zoo 4.0]] server, run the **RegRhinoLM4.exe** utility.

This change needs to be done one each Rhino workstation that is being served by the Zoo.
