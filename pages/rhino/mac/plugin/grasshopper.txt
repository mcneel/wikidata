====== Will Grasshopper 1 for Windows run in Rhino 5 for Mac? ======
> **Summary:** //No, but keep reading//

Plug-ins written for Rhino for Windows can not be used in Rhino for Mac.
This means that the Grasshopper plug-in for Windows Rhino can not be used.

Grasshopper will not be included as part of Mac Rhino for the V5 product life cycle. Grasshopper 1 will be part of the V6 shared codebase, so Grasshopper 1 will eventually be included in Rhino for Mac V6. 
After V6 for Windows is released, then Mac Rhino will shift to the shared V6 codebase. Then work can begin on the user interface differences between the Windows and Mac platforms. There is no estimate of when this work will be completed.

There is a partial, "proof-of-concept" implementation of Grasshopper in the Mac Work In Progress (WIP). It is not production ready. Since it is incomplete, the command name is ExplicitHistory.

Anyone that owns a Mac Rhino license can participate in the WIP.
