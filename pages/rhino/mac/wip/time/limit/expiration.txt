====== The WIP has a time limit. What happens when it expires? (Rhino for Mac) ======
> **Summary:** //The WIP has a time limit. What happens when it expires?//

The expiration ensures that everyone is testing the latest version and not reporting problems that have already been fixed.  Before each RhinoWIP version expires, a new WIP will be available for you to you [[http://www.rhino3d.com/go/download/rhino-for-mac/wip/latest|download]]. RhinoWIP checks for updates each time it starts and will notify you if a new version is available. A notice will also be posted on the [[https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/serengeti|Serengeti section]] of the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/|Discourse Forum]] each time a new Rhino WIP version is available.
