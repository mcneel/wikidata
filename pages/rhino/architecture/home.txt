===Structural Engineering with Rhino===

==Interoperability with Sturctural software==
  * Tekla
  * Geometry Gym
  * Grasshopper

==Quick analysis with Rhino==
  * Karumba
  * Kangaroo

----
===Computational Design===
Rhino and especially Grasshopper have lead in the revolution of computational design in Architecture and fabrication.

==Learning Grasshopper==
It is important to learn Grasshopper.

----
===Using Rhino for Topography===
Rhino can be used to create topographic maps. The difficult part of the process is understanding the information you have to start and how to massage that information to get to a Topo.

  * Getting topo from Google Earth
  * Creating a topo from Points
  * Creating a topo from Curves
  * Creating a topo From Survey information.
  * Creating a topo from a mesh.
