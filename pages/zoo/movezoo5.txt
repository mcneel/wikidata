======Moving a Zoo 5 Server======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses the steps to moving the Zoo 5 server software from one server to another.//

=====More Information=====
Moving the Zoo license manager software from one server to another is really no different than installing the Zoo software from scratch.

Note, there is no way to "move" or "copy" McNeel product CD-Keys from one Zoo server to another. Product CD-Keys must be added to the new Zoo server just as you did with your original Zoo server.

=====Steps=====
  * Download the latest and greatest version of the Zoo from **[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/zoo/5.0/commercial|here]]**.
  * Install the Zoo server software on your new server.
  * Start the Zoo Administrator.
  * Add your product CD-Keys.
  * Start the Zoo service if needed.
  * Redirect your Rhino clients to the new Zoo server by modifying either the [[zoo:findzooserver|Windows Registry]] or your Domain Name System (DNS) server's  [[zoo:findzooserver|default Zoo server name]].

When everything is working as expected, uninstall the Zoo software from the old server.
