====== Rhino 6でレイアウトを使用する場合のヒント ======
[[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/layouts5|Rhino のレイアウト入門]] に戻る

The Layout concept is identical in Rhinoceros 5 & Rhinocers 6.
However, there are a few minor changes in the interface that will help you use the Rhino 5 Layouts tutorial.

These are what you will need to navigate when using Rhino 6 and Rhino 5 layout tutorial.
  * To location the The Annotation scale setting, click the **Tools** menu, and **Options**.
  * In the **Rhino Options** dialog, under **Document Properties**, pick **Annotation Style**.
  * On the **Annotation Style** panel, **Enable annotation space scale** is here in Rhino 6.{{:rhino:annoation_scale_image.png?500|}}

  * **Enable model space scale** is optional in Rhino 6. To be compatible with Rhino 5, just keep it checked.
  * In Rhino 6, the Annotation style will control both the text and dimensions that are assigned to it. You can make a new style from a Template with the **New** button. {{:rhino:layout03.png?500|}}
  * Use the radio button to select the current style.{{:rhino:layout02.png?500|}}
  * Like other styles, all new dimensions and annotation text will be assigned to the current annotation style.

===== Is your annotation text very large when you open or import a model or DWG into Rhino 6? ===== 
The **Enable layout space scale** is likely check and should be **//unchecked//**. When unchecked, this setting will allow the model space test height to be displayed on the layout, instead of forcing the text to be displayed on the layout full size. 
  * If **Enable layout space scale** is **unchecked** or disabled, the text is 6 units high, and the display scale on the detail is 1/24, then the text will be scaled to display 1/4 unit high on the layout.
  * If **Enable layout space scale** is **checked** or enabled, it will be the full 6 units high on the layout. This is very large on a layout that may be only 24x18. To solve this, //uncheck// **Enable layout space scale.**
