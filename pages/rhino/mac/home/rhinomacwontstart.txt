====== Rhino 8 Mac with Enscape Reporting "License Not Found" ======
Rhino 8 Mac with Enscape installed, sometimes reports "License not found" error and will not open.

{{:rhino:mac:home:license_not_found.png?300|}}

This happens because Rhino was not initialized  before Enscape was install and Enscape created ~/Library/Application Support/McNeel with wrong permissions.

The "fix" is to remove Enscape and all supporting files and then re-install and run Rhino **first** before re-installing Enscape.
 
1. Restart your Mac.

2. Make sure Rhino 8 is not running.

3. Launch Terminal.

4. Remove the folders that Enscape created.

- (a) If Rhino 7 is installed and working and you only want to fix Rhino 8, run 
**rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0**

- (b) Otherwise, run **rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel**

5. Start Rhino 8

6. With Rhino successfully starting, now you can reinstall Enscape
