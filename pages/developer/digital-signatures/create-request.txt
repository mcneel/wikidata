====== Digitally Signing Plug-ins ======
> **Developer:** //[[developer:zoo|Zoo 5.0]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses how to digitally sign Zoo 5.0 and Rhino 5 plug-ins.//

To add plug-ins to Zoo 5.0, and to call the license functions from within your Rhino 5 plug-in, you must digitally sign your plug-ins using a certificate signed by the Robert McNeel & Associates Code Signing Authority.

=====Generate a private key and certificate signing request =====
  * Download and install **[[http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html|OpenSSL]]**.
  * Save the contents of **{{:developer:digital-signatures:mcneelcodesigning.zip|McNeelCodeSigning.zip}}** into a folder where you have write permissions. This is generally in your plug-in project folder.
  * Start a Windows Command Prompt.
  * Add the OpenSSL installation folder to your Windows path.
<code>
set path=C:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin;%path%
</code>
  * From the command prompt, run **CreateRequest.bat <filename>**, where filename is the name (without an extension) that will be used to save your private key (.KEY), certificate signing request (.CSR), and final signed digital certificate (.CRT).
  * You will be prompted to answer some questions. Be sure to answer them correctly.

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) []: <COUNTRY NAME>
State or Province Name (full name) []: <STATE OR PROVINCE>
Locality Name (eg, city) []: <CITY>
Organization Name (eg, company) []: <ORGANIZATON>
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: <ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT>
Common Name (eg, your websites domain name) []: <DOMAIN NAME>

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []: <PASSWORD>

===== Requesting a signed digital certificate =====
  - Email the certificate signing request (.CSR) created above to [[brian@mcneel.com|Brian Gillespie]], along with a request for a certificate.
  - We will process your request and, if it is approved, will send you a signed digital certificate (.CRT).

===== Creating a personal information exchange =====
To digitally sign your Zoo 5.0 or Rhino 5 plug-in, convert the signed digital certificate (.CRT), emailed to you upon approval, into a personal information exchange (.PFX) file.
  * Copy the signed digital certificate (.CRT) you receive into the same folder as your private key (.KEY) and certificate signing request (.CSR).
  * Start a Windows Command Prompt.
  * Add the OpenSSL installation folder to your Windows path.
<code>
set path=C:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin;%path%
</code>
  * From the command prompt, run **MakePfxFile.bat <filename>**, where filename is the name (without an extension).
<code>
C:\Dev\Zoo\TestZooPlugin>MakePfxFile.bat TestZooPluginKey
Loading 'screen' into random state - done

Verifying - Enter Export Password: <PRESS ENTER>
Created 'TestZooPluginKey.pfx'. Use this to sign your executable code.
</code>

===== Sign your plug-ins =====
  * Now that you have a personal information exchange (.PFX), you can use it to sign Zoo 5.0 and Rhino 5 plug-ins.
  * Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt.
  * Use **Signtool.exe**, with the following syntax, to digitally sign your plug-ins.
<code>
signtool.exe sign /f <filename>.pfx /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll /v <plugin>
</code>
  * For example:
<code>
C:\Dev\Zoo\TestZooPlugin> signtool sign /f TestZooPluginKey.pfx /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll /v TestZooPlugin.dll
The following certificate was selected:
    Issued to: MCNEEL.COM
    Issued by: McNeel Software Development
    Expires:   <DATE>
    SHA1 hash: <HASH>

Done Adding Additional Store
Successfully signed and timestamped: TestZooPlugin.dll

Number of files successfully Signed: 1
Number of warnings: 0
