We have changed and clarified the [[https://www.rhino3d.com/6/eula|End User License Agreement]] for Rhino 6.

There are three ways to use your license:
  - Single-computer: use Rhino **exclusively** on one computer.
  - Floating licenses across a **company's private network** using [[zoo:home|the Zoo]].
  - Share license on **multiple computers** using [[rhino:6:cloud_zoo:setup|Cloud Zoo For Rhino 6]].
    - Add your license and it will float to any computer you have access to using the Internet instead of a local area network by logging in with your Rhino Account.
    - For multiple users, use the Cloud Zoo to create teams, add multiple licenses, and invite users to join the Team to share the licenses over the internet.

We recommend using Cloud Zoo for maximum flexibility. A detailed comparison of licensing options can be found at [[https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/licensing-and-administration|Rhino 6 License and Administration]]
