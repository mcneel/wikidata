> **Developer:** //[[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]]//
> **Summary:** //Calculate the path of a drop of liquid over a NURBS-surface//

=====More information=====
This [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] shows how to use some nice features such as commandline options and preview geometry.

The path calculated is the steepest path downhill, the drag and impulse of the drop are ignored.

Many more scripts like this one are available from [[http://www.reconstructivism.net|Reconstructivism.net]].
