====== Paneling Tools in Rhino for Mac ======

**//PanelingTools//**is a specialized plugin developed by McNeel and is made available for free to //Rhino 5 for Windows// users. The plugin supports generating 2D and 3D patterns, surface rationalizations and variable paneling.

PanelingTools will also be made available for free for the //Rhino for Mac// users once the plugin support is added to the Rhino for Mac. In the meanwhile, you can access PanelingTools in the Mac through the //Rhino for Mac WIP//. You can get the WIP from here:  http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5/evaluation/

Please note that the Rhino for Mac WIP is a Work-In-Progress, so there may be instability, bugs, half-finished development work. There will be new WIPs as we add features and fix bugs.

Note that PanelingTools commands are available through the “commandline” only (type “pt” and the list of commands will Autocomplete). All manuals and documentations are available here: http://wiki.mcneel.com/labs/panelingtools
