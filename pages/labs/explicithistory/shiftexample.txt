All data in Explicit History is stored in lists. Sometimes you need to perform an action on each item in a list which depends on neighbouring items. For example, if you want to connect each point in a list of points with the next one, you need to somehow get at that second point. There are several ways available of doing this, but Shift is an exceptionally useful one. Shift will move all the values in a list a number of indices to the left or right.

\\

This example connects two sets of points while the second set is subject to a user-controlled Shift.
