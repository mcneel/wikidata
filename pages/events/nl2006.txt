=====What's Pecha Kucha?=====
Born in Tokyo, a few years ago, Pecha Kucha is a unique show-and-tell event where creative people from all disciplines present their work, their ideas or even their holiday snaps.

Pecha Kucha roughly translates as chit-chat. 12 participants get to **show 20 slides for 20 seconds each**, meaning the audience experiences an exhilarating high speed journey through a kaleidoscope of inspirations, ideas and work.

"Yeah! That was a very interesting meeting.Funny to see how Rhino is used
in so many different ways. astronaut, sculptor, boatbuilder, sailmaker,

aircraft designer, shoemaker, archaeologist, deckmakers, yacht-interior

builder, [[rhino:architecture|Architecture]] student, packaging designer, ... and I have

defenitly forgotten someone. Btw, how would you call David Ruttens work?

Chaos-researcher?? I don't know.

And Erik, I still have that picture in my head with the "essential lines

to make a shoe". Amazing what just a few curves can do :)

greets and till next year"

"Congratulations with the successful User meeting of last Saturday. Also thanks for the hospitality to show my products to the public. I have enjoyed the surprising presentations with pleasure."
//Lex Lennings//

"Great event, thanks to Gerard and Rinus for the organisation and management. Thanks to all the users too, for their amazing (well frankly - quite mind blowing) presentations. It was amazing to see Rhino used in so many different applications and great to meet the users personally. hope to join next time"
//Raja Thomas//

----
"I want to thank Rinus and Gerard and all the other people who made a
contribution for the interesting and pleasant meeting they have realised.

Lots of different perpectives on space were offered, and it was gripping to

see how people with different goals all use Rhino to create shapes.

I had fun and went home with fresh ideas,  new perspectives and friendly

feelings (and could not sleep before realising a dome with Leonardo Sticks).

Count me in for next year."

//Erik Hondebrink//

----
"Rinus and Gerard, thank you very much for organizing this event. I met a lot of nice and interesting people, with whom I, unfortunately, have had no contact ever since. I would really like to stay in touch witch everyone, but I'm not sure that the newsgroup is the best way to do so. Hope to meet you elsewhere, or else, at the next user meeting"
