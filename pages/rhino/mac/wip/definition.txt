====== What is a WIP? (Rhino 5 for Mac) ======
> **Summary:** //What is the Rhino for Mac WIP version?//

WIP stands for Work-In-Progress.  It is our form of "beta," and often is released in parallel with a stable commercial release but the WIP contains experimental or half-finished features.  WIPs are generally available to any user who owns the commercial (or Edu) version of the software.  The WIP can be unstable, have bugs, and contain unfinished features.
