=====Question=====
When I launch Rhino 4.0, I get the following error:

**//This license of Rhinoceros is already in use on <COMPUTER NAME>.//**

=====Answer=====
You can receive this message if:
  - The same Rhino 4.0 CD-Key was used to install Rhino on more than one workstation.
  - One of Rhino 4.0 CD-Keys you added to your Zoo 4.0 server was also used during a stand-alone node installation.

If all of the workstations are supposed to be running as workgroup (or network) nodes, which obtain their licenses from a Zoo 4.0 at run time, then you can solve this problem by following these steps.

  - Launch Rhino 4.0
  - Pick Help -> About Rhinoceros.
  - If the About dialog box reports that it's license is stand-alone node, then:
    - Close Rhino and restart Rhino by running it as an administrator.
    - Pick Tools -> License Manager -> Workgroup Node.
    - Close Rhino.

When you start Rhino again, it will be running as a workgroup node.
