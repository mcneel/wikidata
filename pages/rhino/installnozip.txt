=====Problem=====
The installer unzips but nothing happens after that.

=====Cause=====
This problem is caused by Microsoft PCA (Program compatibility assistant), perhaps because an earlier attempt to install Rhino was cancelled.

=====Answer=====
  - Restart Windows
  - Open the file Explorer and browse to the downloaded executable file, and select it.
  - Press and hold Shift
  - Right-click on the executable the run it.
  - A small dialog asking for a language will come up
  - Let up the Shift key
  - Choose English and continue
**//Note://** You may also get a message that you are trying install Rhino on an unsupported operating system. The fix for this problem is in the **[[windowsnotsupportederror|Windows not supported]]** article.
