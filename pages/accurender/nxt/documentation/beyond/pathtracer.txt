====== Path Tracer ======

nXt provides an alternative rendering algorithm known as a Path Tracer.  The Path Tracer can provide a better quality finished product for many models (with a simpler setup), but does so at the expense of a more complex and time-consuming calculation.  The Path Tracer begins by displaying a very grainy or "noisy" image which gradually refines and becomes smooth.  This process is known as convergence.  Some scenes will converge very quickly, others will take many hours.

To enable the Path Tracer, check the box on the Lighting->Advanced tab.

To disable the Path Tracer and return to the Standard method, uncheck the same box.

**Additional Notes:**

  * In general, images rendered using the Path Tracer will take longer to converge than images rendered using the Standard method.  Interior daylight simulations, particularly those scenes where the windows are relatively small, may take much longer.  On the other hand, the Path Tracer is less sensitive to instancing, plants, and displacement maps.  Models which rely heavily on these features may actually converge faster using the Path Tracer.  
  * The Standard algorithm produces a very high-quality simulation.  For many models, the difference in quality between the Standard method and the Path Tracer can be very subtle, particularly if indirect lighting is enabled.  The difference in quality may not be worth the extra processing time.  
  * The Path Tracer is almost always easier to configure and set up than the Standard method.  Advanced settings such as reflection shaders, daylight portals, and ambient lighting, are not used when the Path Tracer engine is selected.
  * Certain advanced effects, such as caustics or blurry transmission, can be calculated with better accuracy using the Path Tracer.
