=====Question=====
Our school is using Microsoft [[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/multipoint|Windows MultiPoint Server]]. Is Rhino compatible with this system? 

=====Answer=====
Windows MultiPoint Server is similar in functionality other Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments, such as Microsoft Terminal Services, Citrix Server, and others. Here is a simple description of MultiPoint Server:

//Windows MultiPoint Server addresses the problem of affordability by giving each student his or her own station with a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse; these stations are then connected to a single computer and share its processing power.//

We **do not recommend** running Rhino in VDI environments. Rhino is a very CPU, memory and graphics-intensive application. Imagine logging onto your own computer 5, 10, 20 or even 30 times and trying to run Rhino in each logon session. Performance, and perhaps reliability, will be very poor, and Rhino will be unusable for anything but the most basic operations.

Technically, though, Rhino will run in this environment if it is installed as a standalone node using an Educational Lab license. Single-user licenses of any kind will not work.

Also, Rhino will also run in this environment if installed as a network node, using a Zoo server to distribute licenses.

Note, Rhino 4.0 will not run in these types of environments due to a technical limitation with it's license manager.
