=====Question=====
I have a new computer and I want to install Rhino version 5.  I have always purchased upgrade versions of Rhino.  Do I have to install ALL previous versions and successive service packs??

=====Answer=====
Simply install the last upgrade version you have on CD.  During the install, you will be asked to insert the CD of a previous version to validate that you have it, but it is not necessary to actually **INSTALL** the previous versions.  Once you have installed the last CD version, proceed to install the latest Service Release - it is not necessary to install previous ones.
