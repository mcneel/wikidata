====== Dimension text does not display in 64-bit Rhino V5 ======

Several Rhino users have reported this problem recently and figured it out. The problem turned out to be Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended.
Apparently they (Adobe) are doing an OpenGL text grab that is messing up the Rhino display. The work-around was to go into the Acrobat tool and remove Rhino from the list of 3D applications.
