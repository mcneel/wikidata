=====Problema=====
There have been reports that after installing Microsoft's Spring Creators Update for Windows 10, version 1803, Rhino is no longer able to obtain licenses from a Zoo server. 

Also, the **[[:zoo:diagnostics|Zoo Diagnostics Utility for Windows]]** now fails to complete one or more tests.\\

=====More Information=====

Although names resolved from Domain Name System (DNS) are case insensitive, we are seeing cases where diagnostic tools, such a **[[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/ping|Ping]]**, are failing because of case sensitivity.

For example:

{{zoo:win10ping.jpg?640}}


=====Possible Solution=====

While we are still working to understand what has changed, in Windows 10 version 1803, one solution is to use a different case when specifying the Zoo server host name. In the example above, you'd specify the Zoo server host name in lower-case characters.

It is also possible there needs to be additional services started up on Windows 10 1803.  Here is an additional article on: [[zoo:windows101803#possible_solution|Windows 10 Version 1803 Update Issue]]
