===== How did my file size get so huge? =====


Periodically there is a post on the Rhino forum by a user that has seen their relatively simple file grow to a huge size and they don't understand why or how to reduce the size back to "normal".  This article will attempt to explain what has happened and why; as well as offer some possible fixes.

===What causes "file bloat" ?===

Many things can dramatically add to file size:

  * **Display meshes** - Rhino uses special meshes to display surface objects on the screen. Very fine display mesh settings can cause large file sizes without you realizing it. You see the display as normal, but you are not necessarily aware of how many polygons the display mesh has.

  * **Textures** - High resolution bitmap textures (usually used as render materials) that are stored in the file can dramatically increase file size.

  * **Plug-ins** can also create their own data and store it in the file; this data can be quite massive as well.

  * **Big data** - finally, Rhino files can simply contain **massive amounts of geometry** in the form of curves, surfaces or meshes.  Large file sizes in this case are to be expected...
