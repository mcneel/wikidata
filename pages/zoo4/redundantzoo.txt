> **Summary:** //A common question regarding redundant Zoo servers.//

=====Question=====
I see the latest version of Zoo has a "multiple server" checkbox. The documentation suggests I can have multiple Zoo's on a routed network, each serving different clients. Can clients be setup to draw licenses from multiple Zoos? This would be useful if our primary server went down.

=====Answer=====
No, clients can only obtain licenses from single Zoo server.

Having redundant Zoo servers is on the wish list. For now, all you can 
really do is install the Zoo on a second server, install the same CD keys on 
it, and disable the service until needed.

If the primary Zoo server does go down, Rhino will continue to function as long as the user does not close this running session. When the Zoo server comes back up, it will resolve all of the used licenses automatically.

Updating DNS servers or workstation registries to point an alternate Zoo server is a pain. But, this is the best we can do at this time.
