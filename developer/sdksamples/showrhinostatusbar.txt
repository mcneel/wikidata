====== Show or Hide Rhino's Status Bar ======
====== C++ ======
> **Version:** //Rhino 4.0//

===== Overview=====
All of Rhino's options, or application settings, that you see when you run the Options command are maintained by a **CRhinoAppSettings** class which is stored on the Rhino application object. This class is a container class in that it holds a number of other CRhinoApp_xxx_Settings classes that help to organize all of the options.

The process for modifying any Rhino option is as follows:

  - Find the container class in CRhinoAppSettings that holds the option you want to modify.
  - Make a copy of that container class.
  - Modify the appropriate members.
  - Replace Rhino's copy of that container class with yours by calling one of CRhinoAppSettings' Set_xxx_Settings() member functions.

===== Example=====
The following sample source code demonstrates how to show or hide Rhino's status bar using the Rhino SDK.


<code c++>
void ShowRhinoStatusBar( BOOL bShow )
{
  // Copy the CRhinoAppAppearanceSettings class 
  CRhinoAppAppearanceSettings settings = RhinoApp().AppSettings().AppearanceSettings( true );
  if( settings.m_show_statusbar != bShow )
  {
    // Modify the desired setting
    settings.m_show_statusbar = bShow;
    // Replace the CRhinoAppAppearanceSettings with the modified version
    RhinoApp().AppSettings().SetAppearanceSettings( settings );
  }
}
