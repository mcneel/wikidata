====== Can I run a RhinoScript program in Rhino for Mac? ======
> **Summary:** //Does Rhinoscript exist of Rhino for Mac?//

No. RhinoScript is based on VisualBasic and VisualBasic does not run on macOS. 

It is recommended to use Python for scripting on both the Mac and Windows version. See the [[http://discourse.mcneel.com/category/scripting | Rhino scripting support forum]] for Python scripting support for both Windows and Mac.
