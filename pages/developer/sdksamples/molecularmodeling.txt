====== Sample: Molecular modeling plugin (VB.NET) ======

> **Summary:** //Complete source-code for a VB.NET plugin. This plugin covers importing and selecting Protein Data Bank files as atoms and bonds in Rhino.//

> **Notice:** //Please note that this code is beta. I have tested it, and it seems to work. But there may be many errors. Use with care and a healthy dose of scepticism. **This is a Rhino 3.NET plug-in. It will not run on Rhino 4**//

----

=====More Information=====
The plugin deals with (among other things) the following issues

  * Reading PDB files and storing the data is custom classes
  * Using dialog boxes in Rhino
  * Inserting meshes, curves, points, pointclouds and [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] surfaces with custom attributes
  * Zooming viewports
  * Orienting geometry
  * Iterating and selecting through existing objects in a document
  * Registry interaction

> **Question:** //Do you have a good site to get sample .pdb files? One thing I noticed right away is that VB.NET compiles .pbd files as "Program Debug Database" files. I accidentally thought this was a sample file at first, and this threw an exception when I tried to load it. -- SteveBaer//
> **Answer:** //Many PDB files are are available for download in the [[http://www.pdb.org|Protein Data Bank]] , which is the main repository of protein structures.  PDB files are organized there by four-character identifiers such as [[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pid=200991117174155&pdbId=1MUE|1MUE]] (thrombin) or [[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pid=207991117174241&pdbId=1A0Z|1A0Z]] (hemoglobin).  If you need an interesting structure in a hurry, why not try the [[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/molecules/molecule_list.html|Molecule of the Month]] ? -- [[http://bathsheba.com|Bathsheba Grossman]]//
> **Answer:** //Oops, I gues the code that reads a pdb-file isn't very robust yet. I also noticed a bug in radius-lookup, will post an improved version shortly.//
> **Question:** //I would be interested in updating your source code and posting a second zip file of source to this wiki page. This could be a work in progress Rhino.NET plug-in that we could update with comments and tweaks. What do you think? -- SteveBaer//
> **Answer:** //That would be great. I'd love to see this evolve into something versatile. I'd especially like to add more geometry-types like Strands, Ribbons, Meta-balls etc. I have no objections to anyone fixing code, adding comments, adding features. But how do we make sure two people don't change it independently resulting in conflicting subroutines?  -- [[people:davidrutten|David Rutten]]//
