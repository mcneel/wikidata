===== Rhino 5 Transition for Beta Users =====

Thank you for your participation in the Rhino 5 beta process. Rhino 5 is nearly here, and we're transitioning everybody from the beta to the 90-day evaluation version.

====Rhino 5 is shipping soon:====
  * **Rhino 5 Beta expires 10-Nov-2012**.
  * **[[http://www.rhino3d.com/sales|Pre-order now]]**: Get the first release of Rhino 5 as soon as it's back from production.
  * **[[http://download.rhino3d.com/rhino/5.0/evaluationtimed/download|Install the 90-day Evaluation]]** to keep using Rhino until your copy arrives.
  

====About the 90-day Evaluation:====
  * The 90-day evaluation will operate normally for 90 days after installation. When it expires, your third-party plug-ins will stop loading, and Rhino will stop saving.
  * Your beta should automatically update to the 90-day evaluation. If it does not, please [[http://download.rhino3d.com/rhino/5.0/evaluationtimed/download|download and install the 90-day evaluation]].
  * The 90-day eval is functionally identical to the final Beta release, and also the initial DVD release of Rhino 5.
  * All plug-ins that worked in the beta will work in the evaluation.
  * Rhino 3DM files are compatible with the 90-day evaluation - the file format is identical between the beta, evaluation, and commercial releases of Rhino.

====Can I unlock the Evaluation?====
  * No. You'll need to purchase Rhino 5 on DVD and install it.

====Known Problems:====
