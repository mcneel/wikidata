===== Frequently Asked Questions: Licensing in Rhino 6 and Rhino 7 =====

====What are my options for licensing Rhino?====
See https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/licensing-and-administration for details.

====Sharing Licenses====

==Can I use one license of Rhino 7 on multiple computers?==
Yes, using one of our free-floating license managers. The LAN Zoo works over your office LAN or the Cloud Zoo uses an occasional Internet connection to float single-use licenses between multiple computers.

==What if I want to install using single-computer licensing on multiple computers?==
You'll need a separate license key for each computer. Rhino 5 allowed more than one validation per single-user license key. Rhino 6 and Rhino 7 do not. Rhino 7 adds Cloud Zoo Personal license management so you can take turns using a single license on multiple computers with an occasional Internet connection.

==How can I share one or more licenses with multiple people?==
Add your licenses to a team in the Cloud Zoo (recommended), or add your licenses to the LAN Zoo.

====Upgrading to Rhino 7 ====

==If I upgrade from Rhino 5 to Rhino 7, can I still use Rhino 5?==
Yes. When you upgrade, you are extending your license to give you access to Rhino 7 features - you are not adding a new license. This means that you can use Rhino 7 and older versions of Rhino on the same computer. You may not use Rhino 5 on one computer while someone else uses the Rhino 7 upgrade on another.

==If I put my Rhino 7 Upgrade license in the Cloud Zoo, can I still install Rhino 5?==
Yes, Rhino 5 can be installed on one computer, even if it has been upgraded to Rhino 7.

==Can I put my Rhino 5 license in the Cloud Zoo?==
No. Rhino 5 does not support the Cloud Zoo.

==If I put my Rhino 5 and Rhino 7 Upgrade Licenses in the Zoo, what happens?==
You'll need Zoo 7 SR 7 (or higher) to support Rhino 7 license keys. The Zoo will group your Rhino 5 and Rhino 7 Upgrade keys into a license "cluster", and will make sure only one is in use at any given time. A user who runs both Rhino 5 and Rhino 7 from the same computer will use only one license.
