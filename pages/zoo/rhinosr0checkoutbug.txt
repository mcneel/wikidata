======Rhino 5 with checked out license won't run======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:zoo5|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses why Rhino 5 SR0 will not start when it has a checked out license.//

=====Symptom=====
After checking out a license from a Zoo 5 server, Rhino 5 will no longer start.

=====Problem=====
If you check out a license and you have **Enable limited license check out** enabled on the Zoo, then when the check out is within 7 days of expiring, Rhino 5 won’t start.

=====Resolution=====
This issue has been resolved in Rhino 5 Service Release 1.

The immediate fix is to the following:
 
1. Delete the .CHK file from this folder:

**Windows 7 or 8**
<code>
C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Roaming\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager\Licenses
</code>

**Windows XP**
<code>
C:\Documents and Settings\<user_name>\Application Data\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager\Licenses
</code>
 
2. From the Zoo Administrator, click on the checked out license and pick **Edit → Recover**.
 
3. Again from Zoo Administrator, click **Tools → Options** and uncheck “Enable limited license check out” until everyone has updated to Rhino 5 SR1.
