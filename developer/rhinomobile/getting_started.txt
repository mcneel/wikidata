======RhinoMobile - Getting Started======

First, you need to decide whether you will be developing in Windows or on a Mac.  This may come down to personal preference/familiarity, but it is important to remember that, if you wish to target iOS, you will need to have a Mac running Xcode (regardless of whether or not you use Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio in Windows).  Similarly, if you wish to target WindowsPhone, you will need to have a Windows PC running Visual Studio.  If you wish to use a Mac as your primary development computer, you will have to use Xamarin Studio.  In Windows, you can choose whether or not to use Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio with the Xamarin iOS and Android Extensions.  Users of Visual Studio can build and deploy to iOS over a network with a Mac "build box" attached.

The following Mac and Windows instructions presume you will be using Xamarin Studio.  (See the page on [[developer:rhinomobile:using_visual_studio|Visual Studio]] for special instructions and considerations).

**Mac Instructions**
  - [[http://xamarin.com/download|Download and install Xamarin]].  Download the Xamarin Starter Edition.  The installer should install the //Mono Framework//, the //Android SDK//, //Xamarin Studio//, //Xamarin.Android// and //Xamarin.iOS// (//Xamarin.Mac// is optional). Once Xamarin Studio and all the associated tools are installed, start Xamarin Studio and make sure it is up-to-date.  On the upper toolbar, navigate to //Xamarin Studio// > //Check for Updates//.  Update and restart Xamarin Studio.
  - [[http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/beginning_a_xamarin_trial|Start a Xamarin Trial]].  The Xamarin Starter edition allows you to unlock a 30-day trial of the full Business Edition, which will be necessary for using RhinoMobile.  You will need to create a Xamarin Login.  If you are unable to start a trial after creating a login, don't worry, Xamarin Studio will prompt you to when you try to build RhinoMobile projects.
  - [[http://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12|Download and install Xcode]].  Xcode is free and can be downloaded from the App Store on and Apple Mac running OS X Mountain Lion.  Once Xcode is installed, you will need to get the Xcode command-line tools. In Xcode 4.3 and later, Xcode Command Line Tools do not come pre-installed, but need to be downloaded from within Xcode. (//Xcode// > //Preferences// > //Downloads Tab// > //Components Section // > //Command Line Tools// > //small download arrow//).
  - [[http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager/|Download and install the Intel Hardware Acceleration Execution Manager (HAXM)]]: HAXM provides a hardware-accelerated engine for the x86 Android emulators. Without HAXM, the emulators are nearly unusable, as their performance lags so much. However, with HAXM, the x86 emulators are responsive and usable. Not as fast as an actual device, but at least passable.  It’s available to install via the Android SDK manager, but the version there is ineffective. Instead, get it from the link above. Note that you’ll want to install the revised version available on that page.  HAXM will not work in a virtualized environment, e.g. a VM, so if you’re doing your Android development in a Windows VM, you will need to use a device.
  - [[http://github.com/mcneel/rhinocommon|Download or git RhinoCommon]].  You can either download RhinoCommon as a zip or clone the repository using git (recommended).  (If you are new to GitHub, there is a [[http://mac.github.com/|GitHub Mac App]] to get you started).  Decompress or clone rhinocommon in a convenient folder, such as ///Users/<you>/Development/Repositories/rhinocommon//.
  - [[http://www.rhino3d.com/opennurbs|Download openNURBS]].  Decompress openNURBS and place the contents in the //rhinocommon/c/opennurbs/// folder (the folder containing only the //readme.md// file).
  - [[http://github.com/mcneel/RhinoMobile|Download or git RhinoMobile]].  Decompress or clone RhinoMobile into a folder parallel to rhinocommon.  For example, if rhinocommon is in the ///Users/<you>/Development/Repositories/rhinocommon// folder, then RhinoMobile should be in the ///Users/<you>/Development/Repositories/RhinoMobile// folder.
  - [[http://github.com/mcneel/RhinoMobileSamples|Download or git RhinoMobileSamples]].  Decompress or clone RhinoMobileSamples into a folder parallel to rhinocommon and RhinoMobile.
  - Build openNURBS for iOS.  Open a Terminal window.  Change directories to the //rhinocommon/c// folder.  Run the //build_mobile.sh// script with the //ios// argument (//./build_mobile.sh ios//).  This script runs a pre-build check to see if you have the proper pre-requisites installed, then builds four different versions of libopennurbs: two arm architectures, one x86 for the simulator, and one universal bundle. Once the libraries have been built, move the libopennurbs*.a files into the //RhinoMobileSamples/HelloRhinoMobile/HelloRhino.Touch/libs// folder.
  - Build openNURBS for Android.  In a Terminal window, make sure you are in the //rhinocommon/c// folder.  Run the //build_mobile.sh// script with the //android// argument (//./build_mobile.sh android//).  This script runs a pre-build check to see if you have the proper pre-requisites installed, then builds three different versions of libopennurbs: two arm architectures and one x86 for the emulator.  Once the libraries have been built, move the //libs// folder into the //RhinoMobileSamples/HelloRhinoMobile/HelloRhino.Droid// folder.

If you've completed the steps above, you're ready to build your first app: [[developer:rhinomobile:hellorhinomobile|HelloRhinoMobile]].

**Windows Instructions**
  - [[http://xamarin.com/download|Download and Install Xamarin]].  Download the Xamarin Starter Edition.  The installer should install the //Mono Framework//, the //Android SDK//, //Xamarin Studio//, //Xamarin.Android// and //Xamarin.iOS// (//Xamarin.Mac// is optional). Once Xamarin Studio and all the associated tools are installed, start Xamarin Studio and make sure it is up-to-date.   Navigate to //Help// > //Check for Updates//.  Update and restart Xamarin Studio.

The Xamarin Starter edition allows you to unlock a 30-day trial of the full Business Edition, which will be necessary for using RhinoMobile.  You will need to create a Xamarin Login.  If you are unable to start a trial after creating a login, don't worry, Xamarin Studio will prompt you to when you try to build RhinoMobile projects as they use P/Invoke.
