===== Plug-ins for Rhino V4=====

**[[rhino:bakerender|BakeRender]]** Plug-in to bake textures with BakeAIR directly from Rhino. //(Version 2.03, works with XP 32/64-bit with Rhino4 SR4/20080807 or higher. It does **not** work with Rhino 5.)//

**[[labs:txtemplate|TxTemplate]]** Plug-in to create image based UV-maps from meshes or render meshes with various controls over colors, line widths, transparency, and layered background texture. //(Version 1.0, works with XP and Windows 7 (32/64-bit) with Rhino 4 SR7/20080807 or higher.)//

**[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/UnwrapRenderMesh.zip|UnwrapRenderMesh]]** Plug-in to unwrap the underlying RenderMesh of a Polysurface. Use this plug-in either to view the packed texture coordinates Rhino creates by default or to create basic texturing templates with other programs like Illustrator or Photoshop. The command **UnwrapRenderMesh** will be available from the commandline once the plug-in is installed. //(Version 2.2, works with XP 32/64-bit with Rhino 4 SR4/20080807 or higher.)//

**[[labs:uvcwrap|UVcWrap]]** New pseudo UV-wrapping plug-in to unwrap a mesh's texture coordinates and transform them as real Rhino mesh objects. After the transformation is done, the unwrapped meshes can be rewrapped to the original mesh. //(Version 0.5b, tested with XP 64-bit with Rhino 4 SR5b/20090226 or higher.)//

**[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/GripRandomizer.zip|GripRandomizer]]** Simple plug-in to randomly move the selected grips of a curve, surface, or mesh. If no grips (control points) are selected, all grips are randomized. Distance and direction of the random movement is scriptable via the commandline. //(Version 1.01, works with XP 32/64-bit with Rhino 4 SR4/20080807 or higher.)//
