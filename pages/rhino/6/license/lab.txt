> **Summary:** //Learn what options exist to license Rhino as an education Lab. Find the best license type to fit your situation.//

Rhino 6 Lab licenses can be managed in one of 3 ways. Please pick the options that best fits your situation. 

  - **Enter a Stand-alone key on each computer** in the Lab.  This can be done for up to 30 computers. This requires manual intervention on each computer for the install and can make it more difficult to re-install later.
  - Manage licenses across the **lab's private network using the Zoo**. This is a very common way to floating licenses within the Lab.  It requires one computer host the Zoo, normally the instructors machine. [[zoo:home|For more details go here....]]
  - Share the lab license on **multiple computers** using Cloud Zoo For Rhino 6. [[rhino:6:cloud_zoo:setup| Click here for steps needed to setup Cloud Zoo...]]
    - Create a Team in Rhino Account.
    - Invite to your team for each person that may want access to Rhino. (Students Faculty etc...)

We recommend using Cloud Zoo for maximum flexibility. A detailed comparison of licensing options can be found at [[https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/licensing-and-administration|Rhino 6 License and Administration]]

You can change from one licensing type to another but it is not automatic. Here is an article that covers the  [[rhino:6:change-license|Rhino 6 change license to use the Cloud Zoo process]].
