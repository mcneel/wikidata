> **Summary:** //Demonstrates how to make a command that splits a bunch of BReps with a plane.//

=====Project details=====

This is a VB.NET 2005 project containing plug-in source code for Rhino 4. It is a complete command class with comments.

This command works as follows:

  - It asks the user to select a set of (poly)surfaces.
  - It asks the user for three points that specify a plane.
  - It calculates cutting plane surfaces through each BRep.
  - It splits the BRep with the plane. If the split was successful, the old objects are deleted and the new ones are inserted.
