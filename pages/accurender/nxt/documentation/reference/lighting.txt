====== The Lighting Tab ======

Create and change light sources with the Lighting tab. Since nXt is designed to simulate real-world lighting, it includes several presets that correspond to real-world lighting situations. The drop-down box at the top of the Lighting tab shows the option to choose a preset, or to create a custom one. 

The lighting controls are organized into separate tabs. Which tabs are visible is dependent on which preset you choose. To make the [[accurender:nxt:documentation:reference:lighting:advanced|Advanced tab]] visible, click the **Show Advanced Tab** box. The other tabs are: 
  * [[accurender:nxt:documentation:reference:lighting:sky|Sky]]
  * [[accurender:nxt:documentation:reference:lighting:lights|Lights]]
  * Backgrounds
  * [[accurender:nxt:documentation:reference:lighting:sun|Sun]]
