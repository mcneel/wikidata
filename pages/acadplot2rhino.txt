====== AutoCAD CDT to Rhino ======
//How do I get my AutoCAD CTB lineweights and print colors into the Rhino?// 

===== AutoCAD CTB =====
At print time, AutoCAD uses a CTB (Color Table) to set the the colors that you see on the display to pen widths on the plot. Color can be set by object or to the layer that the object is assigned. 
It is this table that you can assign the ACI (AutoCAD Color Index) to the a print width in mm.

If the objects or layers ACI 1 is red, then it is plotted with the pen weight that is set in the CTB file. 
You can have a library of many CTB files, that configure the plotting of red differently. For example ACi 1 or Red my plot with a pen weight of .5mm and color of red in one CTB, and pen weight of .25 and color of gray in another. The CTB that is assigned at plot time will determine this.

===== Rhino Print Settings =====
When you are working in Rhino, you may want to assign these setting to your Rhino model. However, Rhino can not open the CTB file. In Rhino, print color and print width are assigned to the layer or the object. 
So in order to use these AutoCAD settings, you will need to assign the color and print width to the layer.

This script will take use the settings from a CSV file as input for a script that will set the print width of layer, based on the color that is assigned to that layer. This is close as we can get the the CTB file in Rhino.

Here is how it works. The settings in the AutoCAD CTB file will need to be transferred into a CSV file. At the time this script was written there was not CTB to Txt conversion that was available.
Download the ZIP. Edit the CSV in Excel or text editor.
