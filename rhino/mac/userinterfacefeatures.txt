====== User interface features only on Mac Rhino ======

There a number of additional ways you can invoke commands on Mac Rhino besides clicking tool palette buttons or typing a command.  

-->Mouse features#

A number of areas in Rhino expect a second mouse button. 

If you have an Apple Magic Mouse configured to act like it has only one mouse button, then hold down the Control key when clicking the mouse button to perform a mouse right-click.  However, you should strongly consider turning on Secondary Click for your Magic Mouse in the System Preferences panel to make a right-click possible without using the keyboard.

If you have an Apple Magic Mouse, it has a touch sensitive top surface and you can pan and rotate views by dragging your finger on the top of the mouse.  Enable this by checking "Scroll with one finger to pan and rotate views".  When this option is not checked, one finger gestures will zoom the viewport in or out.  All the Magic Mouse touch gestures can be disabled by unchecking "Enable Magic Mouse gestures" in Rhinoceros > Preferences > Mouse > Magic Mouse.

If you have a third party mouse with more than three buttons, you can have the extra buttons execute Rhino commands.  See Rhinoceros > Preferences > Mouse > Buttons for attaching the commands to mouse buttons.

====Trackpad features====

If you have a laptop, you can use two fingers to pan and rotate viewport views.  In Rhinoceros > Preferences > Trackpad, check the "Use two fingers to pan and rotate viewport views" option.

You can also assign commands to three finger or four finger swipes on the laptop trackpad.  See Rhinoceros > Preferences > Trackpad.  Mac OS X also assigns actions to these gestures, so you will need to disable the OS X settings in System Preferences.  It is our experience that the four finger left and right swipes can be unreliable, and the four finger up and down swipes never work.

====Screen edges====

In Mac Rhino, you can run a command by touching one of the edges of the display with the mouse cursor.  In Rhinoceros > Preferences > Mouse > Screen Edges, type the command you want executed when you touch a screen edge.

====Additional Commands====

The following commands have been added to Mac Rhino for use in mouse gestures, trackpad gestures, and mouse buttons.

**_-Layer _Visible=_Toggle _Enter** (which toggles Layers Panel visibility)\\ 
**ToggleObjectPropertiesPanel**\\ 
**ToggleOsnapPanel**\\ 

The above commands hide or show the corresponding panel.  For example, if you enter "ToggleObjectPropertiesPanel" in the Rhinoceros > Preferences > Mouse > Screen Edges tab as the Right edge command, then touching the right screen edge will make the Object Properties panel appear or disappear.  This is especially useful on laptops to provide more screen space for modeling.

**ToggleOsnapPanelUnderCursor**

This command can be assigned to a mouse button if you have a mouse with four or more buttons, or can be assigned to a trackpad swipe gesture.  The command pops up the Osnaps panel under your cursor making it easy to change Osnaps settings, and the panel will disappear when you move the mouse cursor off the panel.

**ToggleMainToolPalette**

This command makes the Main tool palette appear and disappear.

**ToggleActiveToolPalettes**

The active tool palettes are all the tool palettes (besides the Main tool palette) that are currently visible.  You might like to have several tool palettes open while you are working and this command lets you show and hide those tool palettes.

In Rhinoceros > Preferences > Tool Palettes, the "Hide tool palettes when starting commands" option and the "Hide main tool palette when hiding other tool palettes" let you keep tool palettes hidden.  The ToggleMainToolPalette and ToggleActiveToolPalettes commands, along with these settings, will allow you to show the tool button palettes only when you need them.  



====Modeling on smaller laptops====

You can comfortably model on a 13" laptop using only the built-in trackpad and a combination of the above settings.  We want to maximize the modeling window and show the other windows only when we need them.  Try the following as a guide:

  * In System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures, set "Swipe between full screen apps" to "Swipe left or right with four fingers".  We want to use three finger trackpad gestures in Rhino, and any OS X settings for three finger gestures in System Preferences will take precedence over Rhino settings.

  * In System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures, check Mission Control, App Exposé, and other settings that might use three finger gestures.  Change them to four finger gestures or disable them.

  * In Rhinoceros > Preferences > Trackpad, turn on "Use two fingers to pan and rotate views".  Two fingers will now rotate a perspective view while Shift + two fingers will pan a perspective view. You can use the two finger pinch gesture to zoom a view. 

  * Open any additional tool button palettes that you commonly use and place them anywhere on the screen, even over your modeling window.  Use Window > Active Tool Palettes for easy access to any of Rhino's tool palettes.  You can use Rhinoceros > Commands > Customize… to create new or customize existing tool palettes.

  * In Rhinoceros > Preferences > Tool Palettes, check the "Hide tool palettes when starting commands" option and also check the "Hide main tool palette when hiding other tool palettes".  

  * Enter "ToggleActiveToolPalettes" for the left screen edge command in Rhinoceros > Preferences > Mouse > Screen Edges.  

  * When you touch the left screen edge with the mouse cursor, all the tool palettes disappear.  When you want to use a tool palette, touch the left edge of the screen.  All the tool palettes will appear.  When you click one of the tool palette buttons, the command starts and all the tool palettes automatically disappear.

  * Maximize your modeling window by clicking the green button in the upper right corner.  You now have the entire display for modeling.

We also want to easily call up auxiliary panels that we use often.  The following is just one possible solution:

  * In Rhinoceros > Preferences > Trackpad > Three fingers, enter "_-Layer _Visible=_Toggle _Enter" in "Swipe left with three fingers…", "ToggleObjectPropertiesPanel" in "Swipe right with three fingers…", and "ToggleOsnapPanelUnderCursor" in "Swipe up with three fingers…".  Now three different three finger swipe gestures will bring up panels.  Performing the same swipe gesture again dismisses the panel.  When you use the "ToggleOsnapPanelUnderCursor" command, you only need to move the cursor off the Osnaps panel to dismiss the panel.

  * With this arrangement, there is still one three finger gesture that is unused, and three unused screen edges that could be used for more commands.

  * You can still use four finger swipes to switch between Mission Control desktops.  In Mission Control, put Rhino in its own desktop so it is not covering other applications. Use a four finger left or right swipe to switch to Rhino or to switch to other applications.
