|Project Name: Scherk Panel|
|Designer: **[[<alessio.erioli@unibo.it|Alessio Erioli]]**|>
|Description: A simple test with PanelingTools and minimal surfaces. The test was held as a part of investigation over multi-performative structural membranes. A saddle component, designed inside [[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sequin/SCULPTS/scherk.html|Scherk-Collins Sculpture Generator]], was used with PanelingTools in Rhino to populate a surface. The result was then exported to Maya for the final render in Mental Ray. You can also check the images [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ale2x72/|here.]] |

|Project Name: Haptic Manifold|
|Designer: **[[http://studioformwork.com/|Greg Taylor - Studio Formwork - GSD]]**|
|Description: Used Rhino PanelingTools for the armature, and Catia powercopy command for the component modeling. The paneling tool, along with record command, allowed for an almost fully parametric armature to proliferate the catia geometry.  The tool allowed for a built in set of flexible constants and increased productivity greatly.  The skin is a variable of cantilevering moment bening and the structure allows for a surface devoid of columns.|

|Project Name: Hugo Häring - Lamella Roof |
|Designer: **[[http://www.peterguthrie.net/|Peter Guthrie]]** |
|Description: A 3D diversion (away from proper work) inspired by fascinating photos on flickr by seier+seier+seier of an agricultural building by German architect Hugo Häring from the 1920s. //[[http://ncodon.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/haring/|Read more...]]//|

|Project Name: Soft-Forms with PanelingTools |
|Designer: **[[<michaelgmccune@gmail.com|Michael McCune]]**|>
|Description: These were screen studies using PanelingTools. The 4-5 soft components were modeled in Maya, imported into Rhino, and paneled across a surface. The explorations were then 3D printed. //[[http://mccunication.wordpress.com:80/2008/12/14/soft-forms-with-paneling-tools/|Read more...]]//|

|Project Name: Parametric Multi-Paneling |
|Designer: **[[<michaelgmccune@gmail.com|Michael McCune]]**|>
|Description: After playing with the [[labs:panelingtools|PanelingTools]] plug-in for Rhino 4, I noticed its great power for mapping components on a surface efficiently. //[[http://mccunication.wordpress.com/2008/12/10/parametric-multi-paneling/|Read more...]]//|

|{{:legacy:en:octatube.PNG}}|
|Project Name: IMAX Theater proposal in Bucharest|
|Designer: **Pim Marsman** from **[[http://www.octatube.nl/|Octatube]]**|
|Description: We designed a challenging cladding for this project. The divisions of the sphere were created using paneling commands. First a triangular paneling by UV dist on the sphere.  Next, I extracted the S-like ribbons. Then the cladding was also created using the plug-in, so panels never exceed production limits of 500*3000 mm. They now are flat (within a region), so the sheetmetal is not going to bend and bubble.|
