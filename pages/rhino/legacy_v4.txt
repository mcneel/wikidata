===== Rhino 4 on Windows 10 =====

Rhino 4 was written for Windows XP, and is not supported in Windows Vista or newer.

If you try to run Rhino 4 in newer versions of Windows, you'll encounter these problems:


==== Limitations and Requirements ====
  * **Memory:** Your 64-bit computer has 16GB of RAM or more. Rhino 4 is a 32-bit application and only has access to 4GB of RAM. Rhino 4 cannot support large models like newer versions of Rhino.
  * **User Account Control:** Rhino 4 was released before Microsoft added **User Account Control** to Windows. Rhino 4 must run in **Windows XP SP3 Compatibility Mode.** Doing so allows Rhino to save changes to your toolbars and settings it closes. Windows Compatibility mode settings are part of the Desktop shortcut properties.
  * **Low resolution:** Your computer probably supports high resolution and high-DPI screens. You must configure Windows to run at a low screen resolution (like 1024 x 768). If you don't, some of Rhino's user interface - like the **Layer panel** - will be blank, and Rhino's toolbar icons will be too small to read.
