===== When I print to the plotter my lines are very faint.  How do I set print weights to my Rhino model? =====
  * Print weights are available for 2D object like curves (line, circles, arc, freeform), hatch, text and dimensions.
  * Print weights are not available for 3D objects like surfaces and polysurface.
In Rhino, you can assign print widths in 3 ways:

1. Assign the print width to the layer.

2. Assign the print width to the object property.

3. Assign the default print width in the Print dialog.

To view your print width before printing, use the PrintDisplay command, and set the State to ON.
Command: PrintDisplay
Print Display (Model Viewports) ( State=Off  Color=Print  Thickness=40 ): State
State <Off> ( On  Off  Toggle ): ON

You can also toggle this from the right click menu.
