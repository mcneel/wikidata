** [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] Surfaces Concepts **

> **Summary:** //Basic concepts of [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] Surfaces Geometry//
\\

One of the main geometry concepts that comes up often when modeling with Rhino is [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] curves and surfaces.  Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline ( or [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] for short) is an accurate mathematical representation of curves and surfaces. The shape of the surface is defined by a number of control points and the degree of that surface in each one of the two directions (u- and v-directions). Refer to

Rhino Help Glossary for more details.

[[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] surfaces can be trimmed or untrimmed. Think of trimmed surfaces as using an underlying [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] surface and closed curves to cut a specific shape of that surface. Each surface has one closed curve that define the outer border (//OuterLoop//) and as many non-intersecting closed inner curves to define holes (//InnerLoops//). A surface with outer loop that is the same as that of its underlying [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] surface and that has no holes is what we refer to as **untrimmed surface**.

The surface on the left is untrimmed. The one on the right is the same surface trimmed with an elliptical hole. Note that the [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] structure of the surface doesnâ€™t change when trimming.

A polysurface consists of more than one surface joined together. Each of the surfaces has its own u- and v-direction; therefore, paneling using uv-directions may not continue the paneling pattern across the polysurface edges. Paneling commands can either use surface uv-directions or follow a specified direction.
