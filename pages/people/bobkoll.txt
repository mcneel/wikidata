=====Lab tips, tricks, projects=====

**[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/Lamp_bk.zip|Table Lamp Project for Laser Engraver.]]**
This tutorial will also work as a scroll-saw or CNC milling project. Instructions are in **Notes**.

**[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/BKwheel_tutorial.zip|Wheel model from jpgs.]]**
The two jpg files are included as well as instructions in **Notes**.  Use PictureFrame command rather than Background Bitmap command.

**[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/11x8_Templates.zip|Two Rhino Templates for High School design/drafting classes v4.]]**
A one page Word document about making Page Layouts for a high school architecture class.

  * A template for an architectural model including a 11x8.5 page layout.
  * A template for a mechanical part including a 11x8.5 page layout. (File and notes contain some instructions for using this template.)

Open the models and **Save As Template**.  Name them as you wish.  When you change the template remember to **Save As Template** so your changes become part of the template.


**[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/PageLayouts_bk.zip|Page Layout tutorial v4.]]**
This tutorial contains a word document and a Rhino model -- a work in progress.  Edit as needed to meet your needs.

**Large Projects with Repeated Parts.** Create blocks of the parts.  Insert them when needed.  And, as a rule, Save Small.  Ferndale HS student created a 309 MB model. After Save Small it was 201 MB.  After creating 'blocks' of the repeated parts, the file size went to 45 MB.  As a rule, encourage your students to **Save Small** to reduce file sizes on your server.
