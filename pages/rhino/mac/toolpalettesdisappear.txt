====== Why do floating Tool Palettes disappear after a command? ======

Hiding tool palettes is intended for small displays where there is not enough room to put the tool palettes beside the drawing window. This feature lets users put the tool palettes temporarily on top of the drawing window. The tool palettes can be called up with a menu shortcut or with a command attached to a mouse button or attached to a screen edge.
