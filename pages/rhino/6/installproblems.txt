**Important note:** You can avoid nearly all the problems and fixes listed on this page if, before installing Rhino, Windows is fully up-to-date with the **important updates** using **[[http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/|Windows Update]]**. To find the status of Windows Update on your computer go to the [[http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/|Windows Update locator page on Microsoft's website]].\\

Once Windows Update is open on the computer, click the **Check for Updates** button. After installing the new updates, please try and install Rhino again.

If the Windows update has stalled, shows an error, or does not seem to finish installing the updates, go to [[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2700567|Microsoft Update freezes]].

**Reporting installation problems**

  - When the error message appears, there is a link on the dialog. 
  - Click the link to open the log and **Save As..** as a txt file.
