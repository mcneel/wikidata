**A glossary of Grasshopper terms**

  * **Item**: A single datum (piece of data). Items can either contain a value, or they can be empty which Grasshopper will call //null//.
  * **List**: An ordered collection of data. Ordered meaning there's a first, second, third, ..., last item. Items inside lists are accessed by an //index//. 
  * **Index**: Indices are non-negative integers where 0 represents the first item, 1 the second item and so forth. Every item in a list is uniquely identified by a single index.
  * **Tree**: An ordered collection of lists. Lists are accessed by a //path//.
  * **Path**: An ordered collection of one or more non-negative integers. Usually written using curly braces and semi-colons as separators: `{0;7;0;2}` Just as you cannot have more than one item in a list with the same index, you also cannot have more than one list in a tree with the same path.
  * **Matrix**: Matrices are rectangular grids of numbers. A matrix has a non-zero number of rows and columns, and each cell contains a number.
  * **Sequence**: A collection of numbers (theoretically finite) where each number is defined by (some of) the numbers preceding it. Every sequence has a rule and one or more starting values. A simple example would be a starting value of zero and a rule that says each entry in the sequence must be one bigger than the previous, resulting in (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...).
  * **Sets**: Mathematically, a //set// is an **un**ordered collection of distinct items. However in Grasshopper a set is just a list containing simple data types such as numbers, text, points, colour, but not curves, breps, meshes or other complicated entities. Reason for this is that every member in a set must be easily comparable to other members in the same set. Set components add or remove members from 'sets' using equality comparisons.
  * **Series**: 
  * **Range**: 
  * **Domain**: Also sometimes called 'intervals', domains are numeric ranges defined by their extremes. For example the domain [2 to 10] encapsulates all numbers bigger than two and smaller than 10 (and, depending on context, exactly two and exactly ten as well).
  * **Graft**: 
  * **Flatten**: 
  * **Simplify**: 
  * **Vector**:
