======How to Render Architectural Desktop 2006 Objects======
The procedure for assigning **AccuRender** materials to Architectural Desktop objects and layers is nearly identical to that of [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]]. The difference in assigning materials comes with the fact that Architectural Desktop can create custom objects such as doors, windows, and stairs. Each of these custom objects can be made up of one or more sub-objects. In order to assign materials to these sub-objects, you must assign materials by color, instead of by object or by layer.

> **Note:** //**AccuRender 3.1**  Build 268 or later is required for use with ADT 2006.//
=====Configure ADT 2006 for rendering with use with AccuRender 3.1=====
The process for configuring Architectural Desktop 2006 for rendering with AccuRender is slightly different from the process used to configure previous versions of Architectural Desktop. If you are using Architectural Desktop 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.3, or 2005 see the [[http://www.accurender.com/faq.htm|AccuRender FAQ]]  for that version.

=====To configure Architectural Desktop 2006 for rendering=====
1. Select the layout and the viewport with the model view to render.

2. Double-click the viewport active it.

3. To create a new configuration, from the **Format**  menu, click **Display Manager**.

4. In the **Display Manager** dialog box, right-click the **Configuration** folder, and then select **New**.

6. In the right pane of the **Display Manager** dialog box, on the **Configuration** tab, select the **Override View Direction** box.

The **Fixed Display Configuration** box, will now read **Viewport View Direction**.

7. Select the new **AccuRender** display configuration in the left pane of the **Display Manager** dialog box.

8. To set the current display configuration, in the left pane of the **Display Manager** dialog box, right-click **AccuRender**, and select **Set to Current Viewport**.

9. In the **Display Manager** dialog box, click **OK**.  Now when the AccuRender configuration is current, the sub-objects in Architectural Desktop will render properly.

You can switch between this configuration and the other configurations from the **Display Manager** dialog box.

=====Assign materials to Architectural Desktop 2006 objects with sub-objects=====
Architectural Desktop objects can be made up of a number of sub-objects. For instance, an Architectural Desktop Window object is made of three sub-objects: Glazing, Frame, and Sash. If you would like the entire object to be rendered with only one material, assign the material to the object's layer. However, if you would like to assign materials to the sub-objects of the window, you must make each sub-object a different color. The typical ADT styles to modify are Walls, Windows, and Doors. They would follow the same procedure as detailed below for Doors.

=====Example: To change the color of sub-objects in Architectural Desktop 2006 doors=====
1. From the **Format** menu, double-click **Style Manager**, the drawing name, **Architectural Objects**, and then **Door Styles**.

2. Under **Door Styles**, right-click the selected the door style object you would like to change or **Standard**, and then select **Edit**.

3. In the **Door Style Properties** dialog box, in the **Style Override** column, select the checkbox in the **Model** row.

4. In the **Display Properties** dialog box, in the **By Material** column, clear the checkbox.

5. Clear the checkboxes for all the sub-components for which you want to assign separate AccuRender materials.

{{:legacy:en:display_properties-001.jpg}}
6. In the **Color** column, use the existing color or select a unique color, and click **OK**.

The number of the color will be used to reference the material.

7. Click **OK** to exit all the dialog boxes and return to the ADT command line.

8. From the **Design** menu, set colors for the other components.

9. At the **Command** prompt, type **regen**.

The objects will now be displayed in their new color.

=====Assign AccuRender materials for Architectural Desktop 2006=====
You will now assign AccuRender materials to the colors of the sub-objects.

=====To assign materials to the colors=====
1. Load and start AccuRender.

2. In the **AccuRender** dialog box, on the **Setup** tab, click **Materials**.

3. In the Assign Material list, and select **By ACI**.

4. Select a color number, and click the **Assign Material** button.

{{:legacy:en:assign_materials-002.jpg}}
5. In the **Material Library** dialog box, click the material assignment for this color and click **OK**.

6. Repeat for all colors that require materials to be assigned to sub-objects.
