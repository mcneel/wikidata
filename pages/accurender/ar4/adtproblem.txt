====== ADT Model Does Not Show-up in WalkAbout ======


=====Problem:=====
When loading the ADT Model into the WalkAbout Layout, the AEC objects do not show up. In may cases, the only the roof and plants show up, but no walls or floors appear.

=====Solution:=====

1. In the model layout, take the model out of plan view. Use **3DOrbit**, restore a custom or [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] Named 3d View.

  * Named [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 3D views are on the **View** menu under **3D Views**. Select from SE,SW,NE and NW.
2. After resetting the view, go back to the WalkAbout tab.

3. Right click and pick **Load Model Now**. You can also take it from the AccuRender menu or type **ar4_loadmodel**.

4. Now all the geometry should be visible for rendering.

> **Note:** //This is an ADT bug and it will happen every time the model is in plan when the **Load Model Now** command or **ar4_loadmodel** is executed.//
