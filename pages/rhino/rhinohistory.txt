  * Jul 1992 - Produced prototype in AutoCAD after about three days of work.
  * Nov 1992 - McNeel/AG agreement to develop AccuModel, [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] modeling for AutoCAD. McNeel would do the marketing and AG would do all the development. McNeel would provide AutoCAD development support as needed.
