====== Smoothing Extruded Arcs that Render Segmented ======
=====Problem: When rendering surfaces created from extruded arcs, the surfaces in the rendered image appear segmented.=====

  * 1.Set AutoCAD's Viewres to 100 and Facetres to 5.
  * 2. You also set the custom resolution on the object. Highlight the surface and type Properties. Under AccuRender Mesh Properties, set Circle Resolution to Custom. Then set Facets to 32.
  * 3. In addition to this, take a look at this FAQ. it explains the source of the problem.

    * Recreating the objects as a polygon with lots of segments (1024 is the max side with polygon) instead may be the best work around.
  * 4. As you are working with this, after every setting you change, reload the model in the WalkAbout view.
