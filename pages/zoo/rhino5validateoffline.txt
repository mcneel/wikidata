======Rhino 5 License Validation======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses Rhino 5 license validation and how it work with the Zoo.//

=====Overview=====
Rhino 5 introduces a new license validation system aimed to reduce the piracy of Rhino licenses. License validation associates your license with your e-mail address (or e-mail domain in the case of a Lab License) and, for upgrade licenses, your previous license key. 

When you add a Rhino 5 license to the Zoo, you will be asked to validate the license online. Rhino 5 licenses must be validated before they can be used.

=====Upgrading from Previous Versions=====
When you upgrade Rhino from a previous version, license validation will associate the license from your previous version of Rhino with the license you are upgrading to. A previous version license can only be used to upgrade one Rhino 5 license. For example, consider a company that owns four licenses of Rhino 4 and upgrades to Rhino 5. Each upgrade installation should be associated with a different Rhino 4 license for validation to succeed.

===== The Validation Process =====
When you add a valid Rhino 5 CD-key to the Zoo, the Rhino License Validation Wizard will be displayed. Follow the instructions on screen to validate your license.

If you receive an error during license validation, please contact [[http://www.rhino3d.com/support|McNeel Technical Support]] for assistance. Please include the error description when you contact support.

===== Validating Offline =====
If your Zoo server is not connected to the Internet, you can perform license validation offline. The process looks like this:

  - Go to a system with Internet access.
  - Visit **https://www.mcneel.com/validate/rhino/5**.
  - Enter your e-mail address and your Rhino 5 CD-key.
  - If upgrading, enter a CD-key for a previous version of Rhino.
  - Your validation code will be displayed. Print it or save it to a text file.
  - Return to the Zoo server system.
  - Run ZooAdmin, add your Rhino 5 CD-key and click Ok.
  - Enter your validation code in the Validation Wizard and click Next.

Rhino will now be successfully validated offline.
