======What is OpenGL?======

The following is a brief description from the Wikipedia:

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a standard specification defining a cross-language cross-platform API for writing applications that produce 3D computer graphics (and 2D computer graphics as well). The interface consists of over 250 different function calls which can be used to draw complex three-dimensional scenes from simple primitives. OpenGL was developed by Silicon Graphics and is popular in the video games industry where it competes with Direct3D on Microsoft Windows platforms (see Direct3D vs. OpenGL). OpenGL is widely used in CAD, virtual reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, flight simulation and video game development.
