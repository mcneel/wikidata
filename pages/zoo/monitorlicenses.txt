=====Question=====
Is there a way to actively track license use in real time from a device other than the server? We would like the ability to let users see who is currently using a license, allowing self-regulation of our licenses. Many of our other applications show a web page or provide a separate viewer application that can display the current use.

=====Answer=====
The LAN Zoo lets users track license use from the convenience of their web browser. Just visit the **status** page provided by your LAN Zoo server by entering:

  http://<zoo_server_host_name>/status

into your favorite web browser. For example, if your LAN Zoo server's host name is //zooserver.mycorp.com//, then you'd enter:

  http://zooserver.mycorp.com/status
  
To determine the version of the LAN Zoo you are running, launch the **Zoo Administrator** (ZooAdmin.exe) and select **Help -> About**.
