======Gathering Console Messages from Rhino for Mac======

It is sometimes necessary for a developer or tech support to request console log messages from Rhino to diagnose a bug or crash.

**To find Console messages**

  - In **Applications > Utilities**, start the **Console** program.  This can also be found from Spotlight or Launchpad.
  - In the left column, click **All Messages**.
  - In the **Filter** box, type **rhinoceros**.

You now have a number of log messages about Rhino. A number of messages probably with nearly the same date and time.

  - **Shift+click** this message to select all the messages in between.
  - Press **Command+C** to copy the messages.
  - Start a new email message
  - Paste the messages into the body of the email. Include an explanation why you are sending us these console messages.
  - Send this to <tech@mcneel.com> with a descriptive message.

Quit **Console**.
