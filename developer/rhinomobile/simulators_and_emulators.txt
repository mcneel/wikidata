**Accessing Files on the Simulator**

The best way to access the contents of the Simulator filesystem is using a Terminal. 

In OS X, open a terminal window and navigate to:

/Users/<you>/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/<ver>/Applications/<long app UDID number>/

(Remember you can use Tab to autocomplete paths as you change directories - useful for auto-completing the longer app UDIDs).
