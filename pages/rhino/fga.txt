-->Why use Safe Mode?#

A shortcut in the Rhinoceros Program group opens Rhino in Safe Mode. Safe Mode is a troubleshooting tool that blocks OpenGL and plug-ins from loading. In Rhino 5, it also blocks loading of toolbars and the Render Development Kit plugin (RDK). Normally, answer "Yes" to loading them. Safe Mode is a troubleshooting tool and is not intended as a working mode.\\

-->Installing Rhino on two computers#

You can install Rhino on more than one computer. Your license agreement allows you to install your Rhino on all of the computers that you directly control, provided that you run your Rhino on only one computer at a time. You cannot "loan" your Rhino to a friend.

-->When I try to open a file, I get an error message about something being unreadable#

Here's how the system works. there are two parts:
    - **Autosave**. If you have Autosave turned on in Rhino, then temporary files are written to the folder specified in Options, and a flag is set that Rhino is running. When Rhino closes normally, it deletes this autosave file and Rhino clears the flag. If Rhino crashes, the flag was not cleared and the autosave file still exists when Rhino starts the very next time. In that event, you are warned that Rhino did not close properly and you have one chance to save your work from the autosave file. If you say no, you lose the file.
    - **Backups**. As of V4 SR7, we added an automatic backup feature. If the feature has not been disabled, when you open an existing file, the changes in this new editing session are saved to a new copy of the file and the existing file you opened has ".bak" concatenated to its name and the file is left in the same folder.
       - Rhino 5 now makes //*.3dmbak// files and has a file type listing to open them.
       - For Rhino 4, use your file Explorer in a List or Detailed view, with Windows Folder Options set to show the file extensions for known file types, and rename the file from //<filename>.3dm.bak// to //<newfilename>.3dm//. Then you can open it like any other Rhino 3dm file.
