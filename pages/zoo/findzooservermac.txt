======How Does Rhino for Mac Find a Zoo Server?======

> **Summary:** //An overview of how Rhino for Mac finds a Zoo license manager server//

When Rhino needs a license from a Zoo server, it determines the name of the Zoo server by looking in the following locations in this order:
  - The Settings file in the Application Support folder. Looks for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server.
  - Queries your Domain Name System (DNS) server for the default Zoo server name.

=====More information=====

====Settings file====

When running as a network node, Rhino determines the name of the Zoo server by first looking in the **LicenseZooClient.Settings** file in this folder:

<code>
/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/License Manager
</code>

The contents of this file looks similar to:

<code>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!--Zoo client settings file written by Rhino-->
<ZooClient>
  <Software_McNeel_Rhinoceros_5.0_License_Manager Server="host name or IP address"/>
</ZooClient>
</code>

====Using DNS====
If Rhino cannot determine the name of the Zoo server by searching in the Settings file, it then queries your DNS server for the default Zoo server, which is the following host name:

<code>
__mcneel.__zoo5
</code>

For example, if your company's domain is //mcneel.com//, then you can add a DNS alias of <nowiki>//__mcneel.__zoo5.mcneel.com//</nowiki> which points to your Zoo server.
