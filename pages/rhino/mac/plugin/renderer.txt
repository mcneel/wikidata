> **Summary:** //Do plug-ins work for the Rhino for Mac version?//

Rhino 5 for Mac is released. Plugins are not supported...yet.

Two BIG things need to happen before plugins will be available for Rhino for Mac:

  - We provide plugin authoring tools to third-party developers.
  - Third-party developers write their plugins for Rhino for Mac.

When will plugins be available in Rhino for Mac? Could be as soon as 5.1...but it depends (see 2 above).
