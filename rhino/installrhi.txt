Rhino 5.6 allows you to select whether you want to install for one user or for all user on the computer. In addition, the deployment of RHI files can be scripted to happen silently.

=====Deploying RHI Files=====
  - Make sure Rhino 5.6 or newer has been deployed on your network.
  - The command to run is:
    
  "C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System\x64\rhiexec.exe" "C:\Full\Path\To\Installer.rhi" /admin /silent


The /admin option installs for all users on the computer.
The /silent option will install without showing user interface.
