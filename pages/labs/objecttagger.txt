====== ObjectTagger ======
> **Summary:** //Object User Tag plug-in for Rhino 4 and 5//

\\

=====Purpose=====

This plug-in lets you attach, detach, search, and view custom tags. It is a very early beta version with a lot of missing functionality and quite probably some serious bugs. Do not use this on important files!

=====Available commands=====

The plug-in adds a new page to the Object Properties dockbar, and it exposes several commands:


| Command name | Explanation |
| otAttach | Attach a new tag to a number of objects (or replace existing tags with an identical name) |
| otDetach | Detach all tags that match the given search filters from the selected objects |
| otClearAllTags | Detach all tags from all selected objects |
| otSelName | Select all objects that contain tags who pass the given name search filter |
| otSelValue | Select all objects that contain tags who pass the given value search filter |
| otSelect | A combination of otSelName and otSelValue |
| otShowTags | Display tags on selected objects directly in the Rhino viewports |
| otExamine | Display the tags on a collection of objects in a treeview |
