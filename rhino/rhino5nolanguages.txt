====== Incomplete Rhino 5.0 Install Without the Language Pack ======
> **Summary:** //Install new language into Rhino 5.//
> **Related Installation Help:** //[[installproblems|Troubleshooting Rhino 5 Installation]]//

=====Question=====
Are you missing templates, toolbars, or plugins? This is a symptom that the language pack was not installed.

=====Answer=====
This can be a incomplete or "botched" install if you are installing from the CD or an error in the install script if you are installing from an MSI script.

If you install Rhino with the MSI install script above, but forget the language pack line, you will need to manually run the MSI for the language pack on your systems. It is also located on the Rhino 5 CD in the Installers folder.

To verify if the language support is installed look for the localization, plug-ins, UI folder here:
C:\Users\<login>\AppData\Roaming\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0. 

If these folders are missing or if you have already opened Rhino, you will have found no toolbars, templates, and Help. To fix this, do the following:
     - Run the MSI for the language pack
     - Open Rhino and type **ToolbarReset**. 
     - Close Rhino and reopen. This will delete the scheme in the registry, and reopening will reset it with the missing components.
