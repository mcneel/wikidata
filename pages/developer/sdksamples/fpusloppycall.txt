> **Summary:** //Discusses math errors and floating point unit issues.//

=====Question=====
When my plug-in tries to perform a certain calculation, I get the following text in Visual Studio's output window:


<code c++>
[[developer:opennurbs:home|opennurbs]] ERROR # 2 .\rhino3MathErrorHandling.cpp:154 Serious math library
  or floating point errors occured.

[[developer:opennurbs:home|opennurbs]] ERROR # 3 .\opennurbs_plus_fpu.cpp:289 ON_FPU_BeforeSloppyCall - fpu STAT
  is already dirty. See source comment for next steps.

</code>
Can anybody help here?

=====Answer=====
These two [[developer:opennurbs:home|opennurbs]] errors are most likey related.

Sometimes it is impossible to avoid calling code that performs invalid floating point operations or rudely changes the FPU control settings. We have found dozens of cases in Windows core DLLs, 3rd party DLLs, [[rhino:opengl|OpenGL]] drivers, VBScript, and the .NET JIT conmpiler where the FPU CTRL setting is changed or floating point exceptions are generated. When these cases are discovered, we bracket the code that is abusing the FPU with:


<code c++>
ON_FPU_BeforeSloppyCall();
// call that abuses the FPU
ON_FPU_AfterSloppyCall();

</code>
In doing this, we don't loose any information about excecptions in our own code and we don't get pestered about exceptions we can't do anything about. Note, if you are calling something that may run the .NET JIT, then use **ON_FPU_AfterDotNetJITUse** instead of **ON_FPU_AfterSloppyCall**.

Also, the following error occurs when a serious divide by zero, overflow, or invalid operation happened sometime before the call to **ON_FPU_BeforeSloppyCall**:


<code c++>
[[developer:opennurbs:home|opennurbs]] ERROR # 3 .\opennurbs_plus_fpu.cpp:289 ON_FPU_BeforeSloppyCall - fpu STAT
  is already dirty. See source comment for next steps.

</code>
These are easy to find.  Start Rhino, run **TestErrorCheck** and set **CrashOnFPUException=Yes**.  Then do whatever it is that made the FPU dirty. You will crash on the line that is dividing by zero, overflowing, or performing the invalid operation.
