=====Question=====
We need to move the Zoo service to a different system. This requires us to re-add our CD-keys on the new system. The problem is that we are unable to locate all of our Rhino CD-keys. Is there a way I can just move my licenses from one Zoo system to another?

=====Answer=====
[[zoo:movezoo5|Moving the Zoo license manager]] software from one server to another is really no different than installing the Zoo software from scratch.

There is no way to “move” or “copy” McNeel product CD-Keys from one Zoo server to another. Product CD-Keys must be added to the new Zoo server just as you did with your original Zoo server.

**Note**, Zoo 5 Service Release 8 (SR8) or newer can export a comma-separated-value (.CSV) file that contains the serial numbers (not CD-keys) of all licenses maintained by the Zoo. This can be useful if you have difficulties in locating all of your product CD keys. You can export the serial number and then e-mail them to [[sales@mcneel.com|McNeel]], who in turn can look up your misplaced license information.

To export serial numbers, launch the **Zoo Administrator** (ZooAdmin.exe) and select **File → Export**.
  
To determine the version of the Zoo you are running, launch the **Zoo Administrator** (ZooAdmin.exe) and select **Help -> About**.
