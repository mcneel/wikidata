====== ATI display card issues and info ======

===== Issues with Ati Radeon display adapters =====

ATi drivers newer than version 8.4 installed on systems with Radeon model cards cause display delays in Rhino's viewports.

Symptoms include delays of 1-2 seconds when:
  * <color red>Panning</color>
  * <color red>Zooming</color>
  * <color red>Rotating</color>

We have contacted ATi about this issue. ATi states that the Radeon line of cards is NOT intended for CAD applications like Rhino, only the FireGL line is. The Radeon is intended for gaming, therefore reporting CAD-related problems against gaming cards is pointless.

Jeff LaSor, the Rhino display developer, has written a plug-in to address this problem. The plugin replaces Rhino's existing display engine with one that handles problems associated with the ATi HD series cards.

Download this plugin: http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/RhinoDisplayEngine_OGLx.zip

UnZIP the file and either drag-n-drop it onto a Rhino viewport or use the PluginManager command to load it. Just to be safe, close and restart Rhino.

This work-around has been tested on HD series cards, but does not appear to be needed for FireGL cards. It will not effect other graphics cards. 

Also, this plug-in will not fix performance problems with wireless docking stations. If your monitor is hooked up wirlessly to your computer, please try a physical connection to the monitor to increase perfromance.

You might experience some situations or problems we haven't anticipated, so please report any problems you encounter while using this plug-in to the Rhino [[news://news.rhino3d.com/rhino|newsgroup.]] or [[tech@mcneel.com|tech@mcneel.com.]]

> **Detail:** //The problem is that newer ATI drivers choke on a very basic [[rhino:opengl|OpenGL]] call that Rhino uses to capture framebuffer contents used in Rhino's double-buffering and triple-buffering mechanisms. The result was that as you rotated and panned the views, everything worked and performed great, but once you stopped, you would experience a long delay (about two seconds per viewport). This meant that operations that simply needed to refresh the display (e.g., selecting objects) would show long delays. This plugin fixes the problem by rewriting the framebuffer capturing mechanism. -Jeff//

> **Update:** //28-Oct-2008.  This fix also works on Rhino V4 installed on Vista 64-bit.//

The older ATI drivers were really bad (they're hardware has always been better than NVidia's on paper), but with the latest hardware and drivers coming out of AMD/ATI, the Radeon 4000 & 5000 series as well as the FirePro 8000 series, I can say that Rhino runs very well and they are very impressive. My development box has the FirePro v8750 in it (for over a year now), and it's what I've been using to development most of the newer V5 display features. I've also got Radeon 4870's here that work really well, and in fact, using VBO meshes on the Radeons blows NVidia cards away in many cases.

So, I'm not sure that the message should really be "NVidia" only. I still believe we need to stay out of the "we recommend brand X" cards. Recommending video hardware is a hit-or-miss situation at best. I've seen the same exact card run differently on two separate machines. In fact, I'm working with someone right now on the NG about a GeForce 8800 GTX not working on Win7 64bit. I'm having no such problems here with any of my 8800's running on Win7 64bit myself. Recommending that an 8800 works on Win7 would not be truthful if we were to recommend it to the guy that's currently having issues with it.

The best we can do going forward is to just say that we believe that with the latest video hardware and drivers coming out of both AMD and NVidia, that Rhino *should* run just fine. If you're using older hardware then there may be issues with V5's latest features, but that we have certain solutions to help fix some of the problems experienced in V4 running on some ATI cards.

Saying that going with "NVidia is safer" is not necessarily accurate anymore. The best recommendation you can make in this area is to get a card with as much video memory onboard as possible - 1GB to 2GB. V5 will make use of it, and it can/will improve Rhino's overall performance.
