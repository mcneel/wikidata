===== Question =====
Are there any solutions for finding the barycentric coordinates of a given point in a quad other than splitting that quad into two triangles?

===== Answer =====
In general, for four points forming a convex quad and a point P in the quad,  there is not a unique solution to the problems:

<code>
P = (a * A) + (b * B) + (c * C) + (d * D)

where:

a + b + c + d = 1
a, b, c, d >= 0
</code>

So the concept of barycentric coordinates does not make sense when  there are more than three corner points.
