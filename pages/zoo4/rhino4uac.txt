===== Question =====
I have a Windows 7 system that cannot run Rhino when configured as a network node.

This is what happens:

  - I run Rhino by double-clicking on the desktop icon. 
  - Rhino gets a license from the Zoo.
  - The main Rhino window does not appear. Rhino4.exe is not running in Task Manager. It's closed by something.
  - The license assigned to Rhino returns to the Zoo's license pool in about 1/3 second.

=====Answer=====
If you delete Rhino 4.0's **Rhino.key** file, in order to switch it from standalone-node mode to network-node, then you **must** run Rhino 4.0 with elevated privileges at least one time. You can run an application on Windows 7 with elevated privileges by right-clicking on the application shortcut and clicking **Run as administrator**.

=====More Information=====
If you run Rhino 4.0 without a Rhino.key file, then Rhino will try to create new Rhino.key file upon successfully obtaining a license, either by entering a valid CD key, or by acquiring one from a Zoo server. 

If Rhino 4.0 cannot create the required Rhino.key file, then Rhino 4.0 will close quietly, as described by the user above.

By running Rhino 4.0 with elevated privileges, at least one time, Rhino 4.0 will be able successfully create the required Rhino.key file.

Once Rhino.key has been created, you can run Rhino by just double-clicking on the desktop shortcut.

Note, you wonâ€™t see this problem on Windows XP, if you are logged in as an administrative user, because Windows XP does not have the security restriction of Windows 7.
