=====Background=====
The PanelingTools (PT) plug-in helps generate 2D and 3D cellular patterns and populate them over rectangular grids.

The plug-in supports intuitive design of paneling concepts as well as rationalize complex geometry into a format suitable for analysis and fabrication. The plug-in is closely integrated with Rhino 5 and is widely used for architectural and other building designers.

=====Download=====

===For Rhino 5 for Windows 32 and 64 bit===
  * Download and double-click **[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/PanelingTools/1.0/wip| PanelingTools installer]] **to install. When opening a new session of Rhino, the installed version will be loaded (no need to drag&drop or use PluginManger to load). Toolbars are also installed, but for the first use you need to load using Tools/Toolbar Layout...
  * PanelingTools plug-in also extends Grasshopper.  **[[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/panelingtools|Click for details...]]** 
  * {{:labs:singlestrokefont.zip|Single stroke font}} (optional). Add this font to your Windows font directory. For example, in Windows 7, drag the RhSS.ttf file into Control Panel>Appearance and Personalization>Fonts. The font will then be accessible from Rhino. This type of font is used mainly to tag parts for laser cutting. 

===For Rhino for Mac WIP===
  * PanelingTools plug-in is NOT part of the released Rhino 5 for Mac, but it is available as part of the **[[http://www.rhino3d.com/go/download/rhino-for-mac/wip/latest|Rhino for Mac WIP]]**. If you own a Rhino for Mac license, then you need to download and install the Rhino for Mac WIP to access Paneling Tools.  Please note that the Rhino for Mac WIP is a Work-In-Progress, which means it includes the latest features and development, but it also means that there may be instability and bugs.  New WIPs are released frequently as we add features and fix bugs.  In the WIP, there is no Paneling Tools menu and all of the commands are available through the command line only.  Type "pt" to see all the Paneling Tools commands in the AutoComplete list.
