======Using NETSH to open TCP Port 80======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:zoo5|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Using NETSH to open Zoo 5 required TCP Port 80.//

=====Overview=====
Zoo 5 communicates with Rhino 5 clients via TCP Port 80 (HTTP).

After installing Zoo 5, you will need to ensure that TCP Port 80 is open, for //both incoming and outgoing// communications, in the firewall software running on the Zoo server system.

Note, TCP Port 80 is open for outgoing communications, by default, in most firewall software. Thus, you should not have to open any ports in the firewall software running on Rhino workstations. 

=====More Information=====

**[[http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/netsh.mspx?mfr=true|NETSH]]** is a Windows command-line scripting utility that allows you to, either locally or remotely, display or modify the network configuration of a computer that is currently running.

**[[http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/netsh.mspx?mfr=true|NETSH]]** also provides a scripting feature that allows you to run a group of commands in batch mode against a specified computer.

**[[http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/netsh.mspx?mfr=true|NETSH]]** can be used, instead of the Firewall applet in Control Panel, to automate the opening of required TCP/IP ports.

It is possible to open these ports on the Window Firewall using **[[http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/netsh.mspx?mfr=true|NETSH]]**. The syntax is different depending on whether or not you are using Windows XP or Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista or greater.

====Windows XP====
**Important** If you are a member of the Administrators group, run the commands from a command prompt. To start a command prompt, find the icon or Start menu entry that you use to start a command prompt session.

<code>
rem Open TCP Port 80
netsh firewall add portopening TCP 80 "Zoo TCP Port 80"
</code>

====Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista or greater====

**Important** If you are a member of the Administrators group, and User Account Control is enabled on your computer, run the commands from a command prompt with elevated permissions. To start a command prompt with elevated permissions, find the icon or Start menu entry that you use to start a command prompt session, right-click it, and then click **Run as administrator**.

<code>
rem Open TCP Port 80 inbound and outbound
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Zoo TCP Port 80" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Zoo TCP Port 80" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80
</code>
