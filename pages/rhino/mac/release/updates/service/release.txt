====== Are there Service Releases or Updates on the way? ======
> **Summary:** //Covers the planned timeline for updates to Rhino 5 for Mac//

Rhino 5 for Mac updates include both bug fixes as well as new features.  When [[http://www.rhino3d.com/mac-feature-compare|comparing Rhino 5 for Mac and Rhino 5 for Windows]], you will notice that Rhino 5 for Mac lacks some of the features of Rhino 5 for Windows.  Some commands, while not included in the initial release, we would like to add in subsequent updates if feasible.  Those who have purchased Rhino 5 for Mac will receive these updates at **no additional cost**.
