====== "Invalid Hash" Error When Validating Rhino ======
This can be related to incorrectly entering the Rhino 5 key.
Try this and [[http://www.rhino3d.com/support|contact us]] if you continue to have problems:

  - Make sure the [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5.0/sr|latest Rhino 5]] is installed.
  - Close Rhino
  - Delete the LIC files located in **C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager\Licenses\** folder. It will look like this //1234567-8f7f-41da-801d-1c87e32f88f5.lic//
  - Run **Regedit.exe**
  - Browse to **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\McNeel\LicenseCache**
  - Delete all the keys in the license cache
  - Start Rhino
  - Enter your license key
  - Try to validate again. (if you are validating offline, you'll need a new code from our web site)
