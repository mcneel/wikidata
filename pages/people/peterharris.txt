=====Installation in Rhino 6 or 7=====

  - Download the zip file to either your downloads folder or a user folder (C:\Users\(user-name). Unzip to the same place.
  - Right-click on the PetersTools.rhp file and select **Properties**. On the General tab, see if the file is blocked. (It'll say so near the bottom of the page.) If so, unblock it. This cannot be done unless the file is in your downloads or user folder. (Actually, I've heard that desktop works, too.)
  - It may work to drag & drop both files into the Rhino window. This is the easiest solution. If that doesn't work, try:
  - Copy the //PetersTools.rhp// file to your //Rhinoceros 6.0 or 7.0 (64-bit)\Plug-ins// folder.
  - Copy the //PetersTools.rui// file to wherever you like to keep toolbars.
  - Start Rhino.
  - Run //PluginManager// and press the install button. Browse to your //Rhinoceros x.0 (64-bit)\Plug-ins// directory and select //PetersTools.rhp//.
  - Load the toolbar that you saved by going to the Tools menu, pick **Toolbar Layout**, then File/Open the toolbar file.
  - If you then try to use the tools and encounter 'unknown command', go to Tools->options->plugins, check to make sure Rhinoscript is Enabled.
