=====Digital Design Studio: Conceptual Skyscraper (B. Arch. 8.5 weeks), supervised by Dr. Chengyu Sun=====
(Samples were developed by 4th year undergraduate students, Tongji University, China, Spring 2009.)

| **Hi! Hydra** by Kai Bao [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] & Grasshopper.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/KaiBAO.zip| Download...]]// | {{:legacy:en:image002.jpg}} |  Currently the super high-rise building enjoys rapid development, rising from the ground level by level. The super high-rise building is not only the breakthrough of land use restriction, but also the unfolding of the technology and even the glory of the city. Meanwhile, architectural ecology has got increasing attention. Architectural form and functional bionic became one way to secure enlightenment of natural ecology for architects. This design begins with Bionics, attempting to seek the new forms of super high-rise building. Contact //[[<ibund@126.com| Dr. Chengyu Sun.]]//|>
| **Pavilion with Soothing Wind** by Junchao LV Grasshopper & Excel VBA.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/JunchaoLV.zip| Download...]]//| {{:legacy:en:image004.jpg}} |  For skyscrapers, a comfortable balcony always seemed impossible. But now, it’s not a dream anymore. With research in aerodynamics and precise sunlight analysis, we designed a balcony system which provides a decent environment with moderate sunlight and soothing wind. This system provides a complex and reliable structural solution which fits all kinds of building types. Its great flexibility could even hold an urban lobby in the balcony! The weaving pattern of both inside and outside deliver the strength of the structure and an amazing architectural beauty. Contact //[[<ibund@126.com| Dr. Chengyu Sun.]]//|>
| **Boundless Climb** by Zhu Zhao [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] & Grasshopper.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/ZhuZHAO.zip| Download...]]//| {{:legacy:en:image006.jpg}} | In composition, the student uses volume to replay Jinmao Tower’s emphasis on line and Global Financial Center’s emphasis on plane. In metaphor, the student uses stacks of stone in ancient Chinese Garden to replay Jinmao Tower’s metaphor of pagoda and Global Financial Center’s metaphor of moon gate. Deduction, volume, and stacks of stone remind the student of the figure of Taihu Stone in ancient Chinese Garden. Thus, he finds the reference for the shape of his skyscraper.

| **Layered City** by Yeyao LIU [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] & Grasshopper.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/YeyaoLIU.zip| Download...]]//| {{:legacy:en:image008.jpg}} | According to the basic principle of the VORONOI diagram, its intersection of the polygon is the farthest point compared with its basic point. Use the advantage point in the down-layer as their benchmark, then establish the road network in the up-layer. This makes the disadvantage point in the down-layer change to be the advantage point in the up-layer. With this method, the forming city of this superposition’s valuation dramatically rises in the space under the method of superposition. Contact //[[<ibund@126.com| Dr. Chengyu Sun.]]//|>
| **Wind Tower** by Siwen XUE [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] & Grasshopper.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/SiwenXUE.zip| Download...]]//|{{:legacy:en:image010.jpg}} |To face the problem of energy crisis in the future, the design tries to find a way of self-supplied energy for skyscrapers. Using the superior height of skyscrapers, the design creates a green energy system which is a set of vertical wind mill. To fit the monsoon climate in Shanghai, the design ensures that each azimuth of the tower can absorb wind energy so that the electricity supply is continuous. The tower shape and the inside space can reflect the distribution rule of wind energy source. Using the wind-rose map and wind pressure-height curve to generate the shape.

| **Water Transfer** By Zhengwei Luo [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] & Grasshopper.//[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/ZhengweiLUO.zip| Download...]]//|{{:legacy:en:image012.jpg}} |The traditional sewage treatment plant not only takes up a large land area, it also isolates itself from visitors. To improve land area use, bring the sewage treatment plant to the upper level of the building, and have the purification process run vertically from top to bottom. Having the sewage treatment tower at the upper levels attracts tourists to visit. This lets residents have a better understanding of the sewage purification process, and also serves as an observation deck. This type of architecture mainly expresses strong properties of public service. Contact //[[<ibund@126.com| Dr. Chengyu Sun.]]//|>

We are trying not only to improve the pedestrian level wind environment, but also to resume a pleasant public parks and green space. Contact //[[<ibund@126.com| Dr. Chengyu Sun.]]//|>
