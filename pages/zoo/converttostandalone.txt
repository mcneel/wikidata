======Convert a Rhino That Uses the Zoo to a Stand-alone License======

> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses how to convert a Rhino for Windows or Rhino for Mac installation from a network node to a stand-alone node.//

=====Question=====
By mistake, I installed one of my Rhino seats to use the Zoo, when I really intended to install it as a stand-alone  license. When I launch Rhino and go to the **Licenses** page in the **Options** dialog, the **Convert** button is disabled. I logged in as administrator and tried again, but the button is still disabled. How do I change this installation into a stand-alone node?

====macOS====

The are two ways to change Rhino for Mac licenses.  

The first - and easiest - way is to run Rhino for Mac, then navigate to //Preferences...// > //Licenses// > //Change your license key//

If the method above does not work, you may need to delete your license file and enter a new one.  Make sure you have your license code recorded before you attempt the following steps:

1. Quit Rhino for Mac and switch to the Finder application.

2. Navigate to //Finder// > //Go// > //Go to Folder...// and enter the following folder:
  /Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/License Manager/Licenses

3. Delete the license file contained in the //Licenses// folder.

4. Launch Rhino for Mac again.

5. Enter and validate your Rhino license key.
