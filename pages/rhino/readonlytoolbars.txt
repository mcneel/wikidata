====== Make Rhino 4.0 Toolbars read-only ======
In school environments it may be beneficial to make the default set of Rhino 4.0 toolbars read-only. This makes the toolbar layout look consistent for every student that logs in.

If you have administrator permissions on your computer, this batch file will:
  - Delete the existing default.tb file
  - Copy default_backup.tb to default.tb
  - Mark default.tb as read-only.

If you have questions about this batch file, please contact Brian Gillespie (brian@mcneel.com).
