======Preparing for 3D Printing======

The terms 3D printing and Rapid Prototyping (RP) are terms that covers a variety of processes which are aimed at quickly creating physical parts from 3D computer models using computer controlled machines. This article concentrates on preparing models for the 3D Printing Process.
