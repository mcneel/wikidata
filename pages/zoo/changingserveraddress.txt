=====Question=====
We are looking to change the IP Address on a number of our license servers. One of these is presently hosting the Zoo license server service for Rhino. As this is a soft lock, I was wanting to check if there was any part of the license that may be disabled by changing the IP Address on the server. The host name and MAC address should remain the same.

=====Answer=====
Neither the Zoo installation nor the licenses it maintains are tied to the server's IP or MAC address. So there will not be an issue with changing the IP address of the server hosting the Zoo service as far as the Zoo is concerned.

If your Rhino installations are finding the Zoo server using the server's (DNS) domain name, then the migration should go smoothly. If your Rhino installations are finding the Zoo using the server's IP address, then each workstation will need to be redirected.
