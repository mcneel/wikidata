=====Downloading the Mac Rhino Tutorial files on OS X 10.7 and later=====

**Note:** The tutorials are written for the Windows version of Rhino. Since the Mac version is not complete, the tutorials have not yet been converted to reflect the differences.

**To download the tutorial files**

  * On the **Rhino** menu, click **Help > Open Tutorial Files**. 

If you do not have the tutorial files installed on your computer, you will be prompted to download them. The file **rh40mac_wip_tutorials_20090112.dmg** will be downloaded to your Downloads folder.

Open the **rh40mac_wip_tutorials_20090112.dmg** file to display a new Finder window containing the **RhinocerosTutorials.mpkg** file.

OS X may warn that the file was created by an unidentified developer and refuse to run it.

If this happens, right-click (or control+click) the **RhinocerosTutorials.mpkg**, and on the context menu, click **Open**. At the dialog prompt, click the Open button. The tutorial installer will start.
