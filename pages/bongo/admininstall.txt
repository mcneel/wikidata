====== When I try to install Bongo 1 in Vista/Win7, it complains about needing Administrator Rights ======
-added 2/4/2011 - John Brock


The installer for Bongo 1 was created for Win2000 and WinXP, prior to the complications of User Account Control in Windows Vista and Win7. To get past this complication:
  - Open the Windows file Explorer and browse to the Bongo CD 
  - Find SetupBongo.exe
  - Right mouse click it and choose 'Run as Administator'
  - Follow the prompts
