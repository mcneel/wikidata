====== Solving video card related problems with AccuRender 4. ======

> **Summary:** //AccuRender and [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] can be adversely affected by legacy video cards or poor video card drivers.  If you are experiencing crashes when loading models in AccuRender, crashing when starting AccuRender or a message 'AccuRender crashed in your graphics card driver.' please try the following suggestions.//

  * Make sure you have the latest WHQL certified driver for your video card.  You will generally find these drivers at your manufacturer's website.  The WHQL part is very important - newer drivers which are not certified by Microsoft are often beta drivers that perform poorly in [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] and AccuRender.
  * Some cards and drivers (particularly older cards like the Quadro4 series) do not like to run two types of 3D window at the same time.  This is a particular problem on [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2007 where the program is, by default, in 3D mode.  Try setting the "shademode" system variable to "2" and then start AccuRender.  (Type 'shademode' at the command line and select '2d wireframe')
  * If both of these solutions fail, it is usually because your video card has poor support for [[rhino:opengl|OpenGL]].  If this is the case, turn down the hardware acceleration on your video card.  You access this setting from the "Display" control panel applet.  Press the "Advanced" button on the "Settings" tab.  Then adjust the "Hardware acceleration" slider on the "Troubleshoot" tab.
