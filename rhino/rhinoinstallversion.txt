=====Question=====
How do I tell what version is installed?

=====Answer=====
Once you have the software installed, you can see the date and the SR number by viewing the "about" information, which appears on the "splash screen" when you start Rhino, or can be viewed by doing Rhino > Help > About [[rhino:rhinoceros|Rhinoceros]].

For Flamingo, do the FlamingoAbout command. For Bongo, do the BongoAbout command.
