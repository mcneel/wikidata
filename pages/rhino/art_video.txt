====== ART Video Tutorial & General FAQ ====== 
[[https://www.rhino3d.com/art|ART]] (Authorized Rhino Trainer) candidates are required to submit a video, 5-10 minutes in duration or 5+ page tutorial on Rhino or a Rhino plug-in. Below are the some examples and recommendations.

These videos are very good examples: 
  * [[https://vimeo.com/channels/rhinotutorials/84982383|Intro to Display Modes]]
  * [[https://vimeo.com/49597954|Modeling a Glass]]

[[https://vimeo.com/help/compression|General Requirements:]]
  * The video review process will take about 30 days.
  * Be prepared to redo your video at least twice, We will give you recommendations and will ask that you makes the changes/additions that we request and resubmit. We could go back and forth with you 2-3 times until the video is tuned up. This will hopefully be an informative process for you.
  * Before you start, close any toolbars from plug-ins that you will not be using. Set the interface as close to the default as possible. 
  * Be concise.
  * Make sure your presentation stays focused on the lesson you have designed. Mention, if needed, but avoid getting side-tracked by, the details of the user interface if they are not specific to the task at hand. It's usually OK to assume some basic knowlege of how Rhino works, on the poart of the viewer.
  * Before you publish or submit a training video, watch your video carefully as a new user - ask yourself if the material is conveyed clearly and completely and with a minimum of fuss.
  * And, be concise.

===== Additional Information =====

**The ART requirement of McNeel Level 1 & 2 training is designed to //teach you to teach Rhino//, not learn it.** 
You should already know Rhino very well and be looking to support and teach Rhino.

**On-Demand will help you prepare for the class, but it will not fulfill the Level 1 or Level 2 requirement.**
Level 1 and Level 2 can be done for no charge in the Seattle, Miami, or regional classrooms.

**In the North American region, Level 1 Online does count for your ART.** You will assist the instructor and help with chat questions for the Online to count as your ART requirement. However, there are no discounts for this class. The online class is not free, but it is already discounted for all, $200 instead of $675. You can take it no charge in Seattle, but do do need to travel and arrange accommodations.

**During the online class you will serve as TA.** You need to be present for all the sessions, monitor the Chat windows, alert instructor of issues. Sometimes the instructor will ask you for a review of questions. You will be trained in the orientation session. It works well, the instructors are very experienced getting the TA comfortable, and most TA's really enjoy this.

**With the Online Level 1 option, you will only travel to Seattle for the Level 2.** We can schedule a Level 2 in Seattle if you give us some input about your schedule. For example, if you think you can make here in December, give us the dates. We will try to accommodate your schedule, if possible. However, we do need to know 6 or so months in advance. So coming to Seattle //**once**// is more economical and time efficient.

**//Will the chat questions interrupt my own participation?//**
If you are learning, yes. 
Some take the class, and then return to TA in the next session. 
The repeat for the TA is no charge. 
The classes are recorded and you can stream for 3 months to review the lessons. So that may be enough if you miss something.

**Evaluation During Rhino Level 2** In this final Level 2 in our classroom, you are evaluated for Rhino skills and knowledge. Some ARTs do not pass and have to take the class a second time.  Another option is to prepare by doing the Level 2 online before coming to Seattle.   

**McNeel Regions**
Your McNeel Regional Office may have special requirements for your ART. Please contact your region and inquiry about any special requirements or restrictions. Find the contact in your McNeel Regional Office [[here.]]

**Submit Video and Apply!**
It generally take 6-12 month for users to get all the ART requirements done.
Please email [[mary@mcneel.com|Mary Fugier]] with any additional questions.
//Thanks for considering becoming an ART.//
