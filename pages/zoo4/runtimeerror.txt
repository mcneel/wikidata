=====Answer=====
You can receive this message if your Windows system does not have the most up-to-date Microsoft Runtime libraries installed. Download and install the following: 

[[http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=26347|Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update]]

**Note:** Make sure you download and install the 32-bit, or x86, redistributable package. The file name to download is **vcredist_x86.exe (2.6 MB)**.
