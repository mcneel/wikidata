===== Question =====
I downloaded the [[http://download.rhino3d.com/en/openNURBS.NET/5.0/release/download/|openNURBS.NET 5.0 Toolkit (2010-3-10)]] and installed it on a clean 32-bit Windows XP Professional machine with Visual Studio 2008 SP1 installed.  The **CS_example_read** project builds fine, but gives the following error message when it executes:

<code>
"Could not load file or assembly 'OpenNURBS.NET'...PublicKeyToken=552281e97c755530' or one of its dependencies..."
</code>

===== Answer =====
OpenNURBS.NET.dll and OpenNURBS.NET_x64.dll, included in the [[http://download.rhino3d.com/en/openNURBS.NET/5.0/release/download/|openNURBS.NET 5.0 Toolkit (2010-3-10)]] download, are .NET 2.0 assemblies built with Visual Studio 2005 (Professional) SP1, including all of the service patches and security updates available from Windows Updates. Thus, you will need to have the following Microsoft redistributable package installed on your development system and any other systems on which you deploy openNURBS.NET 5.0:
 
[[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=766a6af7-ec73-40ff-b072-9112bab119c2|Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package ATL Security Update]]

Also, make sure the correct openNURBS.NET DLL is in the same (output) folder as the .exe you are building.

  * OpenNURBS.NET.dll for x86 builds.
  * OpenNURBS.NET_x64.dll for x64 builds.

Note, if you have not moved the project files around or if you have not 
modified the project, this is done for you automatically.
