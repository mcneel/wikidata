=====Validating Rhino Offline=====
There are two reasons to do this:
Either your computer is not attached to the internet.
Or you have a computer that can not resolve to the Rhino validation server because of firewall or other blocking program or configuration.

To test access to the validation server, use this [[https://api.mcneel.com/|link.]]
You should see a page that the site is not for humans. If you can't reach that page, you are blocked, probably by a local firewall.


Rhino licenses must be validated before they can be used. 
For offline computers, you can perform license validation offline.

  - When you launch Rhino, you will be notified that Rhino is unable to connect to the validation server. {{ :zoo:validate01.png?direct&200 |}}
  - Click the button **"Get Validation Code Manually"**.
  - The following dialog box will appear. {{ :zoo:validate02.png?direct&200 |}} 
  - Write down the **License Key**, **Device Name**, and **Device ID** information that is presented.
  - Go to a system with Internet access.
  - In a web browser, go to https://www.rhino3d.com/validate.
  - Enter your **email address**, Rhino **license key**, **Device Name**, and **Device ID** information into the form. {{ :zoo:validate2.jpg?direct&200 |}}
  - If upgrading, you will also enter a license key for a previous version of Rhino.
  - Your validation code will be displayed. Print or save it to a text file. //This code needs to be used within 24-hours of generating it//.
  - Return to the offline system and pick **Continue** button.
  - Enter your validation code in the Validation Wizard and click Next.

Rhino will now be successfully validated offline.

**Note:** For network-wide deployment and using an offline LAN Zoo, the necessary data is presented when you try to add a license to that Zoo. For a Zoo-specific write-up of the preceding instructions, see https://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/rhinovalidateoffline#validating_offline
