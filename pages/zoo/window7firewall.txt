======Open TCP Port 80 in Windows Firewall======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:zoo5|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Demonstrates how to open TCP Port 80 in the Windows firewall.//

===== Overview =====
Zoo 5 communicates with Rhino 5 clients via TCP Port 80 (HTTP).

After installing Zoo 5, you will need to ensure that TCP Port 80 is open, for //both incoming and outgoing// communications, in the firewall software running on the Zoo server system.

Note, TCP Port 80 is open for outgoing communications, by default, in most firewall software. Thus, you should not have to open any ports in the firewall software running on Rhino workstations. 

===== Steps=====
The following instructions are for opening TCP Port 80 in the Window Firewall - the firewall software included with Windows. If you are using an alternate firewall, please consult their documentation.
