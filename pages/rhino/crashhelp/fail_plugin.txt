**Try:**\\
  -Start Rhino in **SafeMode**. 
  -On the Rhino **Tools** menu, click **Options** > **Plugins**.
  -Clear the **Enabled** check box for all of the plug-ins that did not ship with Rhino.
  -At the bottom of the dialog box, check the **Ask to load disabled plug-ins** box.
  -Restart Rhino without using SafeMode. 
  -Answer **No** to loading all of the plug-ins you disabled.


**If Rhino starts with some plug-ins disabled**\\
The problem is one of the disabled plug-ins.

**Try:**\\ 
  -Restart Rhino **normally** and answer **Yes** to loading **one plug-in at a time** and **No** to the rest until you determine which one causes the problem.
  -When you have determined which plug-in causes a problem, on the **Tools** menu, click **Options** > **Plugins**.
  - Check the **Enabled** box for all of the plug-ins that do not cause a problem.
