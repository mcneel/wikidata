===== Automating installation of Rhino 6 =====

Rhino 6 installs from a single executable installer, and can be fully automated.

setup.exe [Action] [Option] [Parameters]

//Note: "setup.exe" shown above is a place holder for the current Rhino installer file,\\ e.g. [rhino_en-us_6.#...exe]//

==== Offline Installation:====
If you are deploying in an environment where the client computers do not have internet access to download additional packages, be sure to first run the installer with the `--layout` option (see below). This creates a redist folder that is used by subsequent installations to install required third-party products, such as the newest .NET framework, and Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime redistributable packages.

|**-package** | (default) install |
|**-uninstall** | uninstall |
