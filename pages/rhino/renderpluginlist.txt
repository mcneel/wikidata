=======Render Plug-in Information for Rhino=======

> **Summary:** //Render engine database//


Rendering is the process of creating photorealistic two dimensional images from three dimensional models. This is a very broad definition, but the field is such an extensive one that it is hard to narrow it down. Some rendering software only implements a very simple rendering. Others introduce features such as animation and physics-based simulation.

There is a lot of information available on all of the render software, usually through sites maintained by the companies that develop them, but also through user-controlled domains. 

Rhino 6 comes with Realtime rendering.  See the [[rhino:6:rendering:realtime|Realtime Rendering Tutorial]] for more information:
