**Android Development Tools - Where are they installed again?**

Xamarin places the Android tools in a specific path that allows it to work seamlessly from within Xamarin Studio.  However, there are times when it's useful to get access to the SDK platform tools manually.  Here are the default install paths for both Mac and Windows:

**__Mac__**

  * Android NDK path: ///Users/<you>/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-ndk/android-ndk-r??//
  * Android SDK path: ///Users/<you>/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-mac_x86/tools/android//


**__Windows__**

  * Android NDK path: //C:\Program Files\Android\ndk\android-ndk-r??//
  * Android SDK path: //C:\Users\[you]\AppData\Local\Android\android-sdk//
