=====Question=====
For two sets of 3-D vectors, I use the method demonstrated in [[developer:sdksamples:anglebetweenvectors|Calculate the angle between two vectors]] to calculate the angle between them. The results for both are always the same - 45 degree in this case. For example:

{{:legacy:en:SdkPlaneAngle.jpg}}

But the result that I need should be that one is 45 degree the other is 315 degree. How to get the results that I need?

=====Answer=====

The following example code demonstrates how to calculate the angle between two 3-D points, given a common base point.

<code c++>
/*
Description:
  Calculates the angle between two points that lie on a
  given plane. 
Parameters:
  plane   - [in]  The plane on which the points lie
  basept  - [in]  The base point
  refpt1  - [in]  The first reference point
  refpt2  - [in]  The second reference point
  radians - [out] The angle in radians
Returns:
  TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise.
*/
static bool CalculatePlaneAngle( 
        const ON_Plane& plane, 
        const ON_3dPoint& basept, 
        const ON_3dPoint& refpt1, 
        const ON_3dPoint& refpt2, 
        double& radians 
        )
{
  // Make sure the points are on the plane
  double tolerance = 0.000001;
  double dist = 0.0;

  dist = plane.plane_equation.ValueAt( basept );  
  if( fabs(dist) > tolerance )
    return false;

  dist = plane.plane_equation.ValueAt( refpt1 );
  if( fabs(dist) > tolerance )
    return false;

  dist = plane.plane_equation.ValueAt( refpt2 );
  if( fabs(dist) > tolerance )
    return false;

  // Make sure base and reference points are not equal

  if( basept == refpt1 | basept == refpt2 )
    return false;

  // Calculate angle between vectors

  ON_3dVector v = refpt2 - basept;
  v.Unitize();

  ON_3dVector zerov = refpt1 - basept;
  zerov.Unitize();  

  double dot = ON_DotProduct( zerov, v );
  dot = RHINO_CLAMP( dot, -1.0, 1.0 );
  double angle = acos( dot );

  // Calculate a new y-axis based on the plane's
  // zaxis and our zero vector
  v = ON_CrossProduct( plane.zaxis, zerov );
  v.Unitize();

  // Create a plane using our y-axis a the normal
  ON_Plane yplane;
  yplane.CreateFromNormal( basept, v );

  // Figure out which side of this plane that refpt2 is on
  dist = yplane.plane_equation.ValueAt( refpt2 );
  if( dist < 0.0 )
    angle = (ON_PI * 2.0) - angle;

  radians = angle;

  return true;
}

You can use the above function as follows:

<code c++>
CRhinoCommand::result CCommandTest::RunCommand( const CRhinoCommandContext& context )
{
  CRhinoView* view = RhinoApp().ActiveView();
  if( 0 == view )
    return failure;

  ON_Plane plane = view->ActiveViewport().ConstructionPlane().m_plane;
  ON_3dPoint basept, refpt1, refpt2;

  CRhinoGetPoint gp;
  gp.SetCommandPrompt( L"Base point" );
  gp.Constrain( plane );
  gp.GetPoint();
  if( gp.CommandResult() != success )
    return gp.CommandResult();

  basept = gp.Point();

  gp.SetCommandPrompt( L"First angle point" );
  gp.SetBasePoint( basept );
  gp.DrawLineFromPoint( basept, TRUE );
  gp.GetPoint();
  if( gp.CommandResult() != success )
    return gp.CommandResult();

  refpt1 = gp.Point();

  gp.SetCommandPrompt( L"Second angle point" );
  gp.SetBasePoint( basept );
  gp.DrawLineFromPoint( basept, TRUE );
  gp.GetPoint();
  if( gp.CommandResult() != success )
    return gp.CommandResult();

  refpt2 = gp.Point();

  double angle = 0.0;
  if( CalculatePlaneAngle(plane, basept, refpt1, refpt2, angle) )
    RhinoApp().Print( L"Angle = %.3f degrees.\n", angle * (180.0 / ON_PI) );

  return success;
}
</code>
