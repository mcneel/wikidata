====== Rhino 8 Mac with Enscape Reporting "License Not Found" ======
**Problem:** Install of Enscape for Mac causes Rhino for Mac to say **License Not Found** or **Initializing...** and become unresponsive.

You might see //"Troubleshooting: Data protection failed"//. //[[https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/troubleshooting-data-protection-failed/136535|Details...]]//

{{:rhino:mac:home:license_not_found.png?300|}}
{{:rhino:mac:home:error_finding_mac_license.png?400|}}

**Cause:** Enscape created ~/Library/Application Support/McNeel with incorrect permissions.



===== Solution 1: Apple Terminal Commands =====

  - **Close Rhino**
  - **Open Terminal**. //[[https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac|Details...]]//
  - **Paste the following into Terminal**, then press Enter. You'll be asked for the password you use to login to your mac. The sudo command runs with privileged permissions, and requires your password to work: <code language=bash>
sudo chown -R $(logname) "/Users/Shared/McNeel/Rhinoceros"
sudo chmod -R 755 "/Users/Shared/McNeel/Rhinoceros"
sudo chown -R $(logname) "~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/"
sudo chmod -R 755 "~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/"
</code>
  - **Start Rhino**
  - **Login**
===== Solution 2: Manually and Complete Uninstall ===== 
**Simplest Solution**

  - Delete Applications:
    - Open Finder
    - Click **Applications** in the sidebar.
    - Drag **Rhino 7** to the trash
    - Drag **Rhino 8** to the trash
    - Drag **Enscape** to the trash
  - Delete Enscape Plugin:
    - In Finder, click **Go > Go to Folder**
    - Paste **~/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/MacPlugIns/**
    - Drag the **Enscape** folder to the trash
  - Delete Rhino License Files:
    - In Finder, click **Go > Go to Folder**  
    - Paste **~/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros**
    - Drag **8.0** to the trash
    - In Finder, click **Go > Go to Folder**  
    - Paste /Users/Shared/McNeel/Rhinoceros/
    - Drag **8.0** to the trash
  - Delete Enscape Data Folders:
    - In Finder, click **Go > Go to Folder** 
    - Paste **~/Library/Application Support/**
    - Drag any Enscape-related folders to the trash
  - Restart your Mac
  - Reinstall Rhino. //If your Mac prompts "keep, replace ..." you did not clean up well enough. Go back to the top and try again.//
  - Start Rhino. It should install and open like it was never installed before. And then it will get a license from the RA. 
===== Solution 3: Manually modify folder permissions ===== 

  - **Quit Rhino**
  - Open **Finder**
  - Set permissions for ~/Library/Application Support/McNeel folder
    - In Finder, click **Go > Go to Folder**.
    - Paste **~/Library/Application Support**.
    - Right-click the **McNeel** folder, then click **Get Info**.
    - In the **Sharing & Permissions** section and click the padlock to enable editing.
    - Change the permissions to **Read & Write** for all the entries.
    - In the options menu (the circle with the three dots next to the + & - symbols), click **Apply to enclosed items…**
    - Close the McNeel Info window.
  - Set permissions for /Users/Shared/McNeel/Rhinoceros folder
    - In Finder, click **Go > Go to Folder**.
    - Paste **/Users/Shared/McNeel**
    - Right-click the **Rhinoceros** folder, then click **Get Info**.
    -  In the **Sharing & Permissions** section and click the padlock to enable editing.
    -  Change the permissions to **Read & Write** for all the entries.
    - In the options menu (the circle with the three dots next to the + & - symbols), click **Apply to enclosed items…**
    - Close the Rhinoceros Info window.
  - Start Rhino.

or 

Please check if you have read & write privileges on these license folders. To do this, right click a folder > choose Get Info > and check the permissions at the bottom of the window that pops up. Make all of them **Read + Write.**
     ~/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros
     /Users/Shared/McNeel/Rhinoceros


  - Start Rhino 8 after making sure you can write to these folders. You should see a Welcome screen to enter your email. If that still doesn't work, try deleting all McNeel folders from both ‘/Application Support’ and ‘/Shared’ before starting Rhino 8


===== Solution 4: Use Apple Terminal Commands to Change Folder Permissions =====
**Advanced Skills Required**
 
  - Quit Rhino 8.
  - Restart your Mac.
  - Ensure Rhino 8 is not running.
  - Launch Terminal.
  - Remove the folders that Enscape created.
     - If Rhino 7 is installed and working and you only want to fix Rhino 8, paste into terminal and press Enter:
     - **rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0**
     - Or, paste **rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel** and press Enter.
  - Start Rhino 8
  - With Rhino successfully starting, now you can reinstall Enscape
  - if you get "permissions denied" as a return when you run the steps above, add the prefix **sudo** then a space, then the command string above. This will call the admin credentials dialog box allowing you to enter admin credentials. Enter admin credentials and the command string should complete successfully. 
  - If all the above fails, you can browse directly to the folder in the finder and delete the folder manually by dragging it into the trash. (confirm with admin credentials) 
  - In some rare cases all the above fails, BUT after a restart the above process finally works. 

or 

Run these command in your Terminal Application
  mkdir -p ~/.config/.mono/keypairs
  chmod -R 700 ~/.config/.mono/keypairs
  
If all else fails, please get in touch with us. Standalone licensing (locking the license key to the machine) can be used as a fallback option.
