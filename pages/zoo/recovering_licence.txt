Occasionally a license is left checked out when it is not really in use. This can happen if Rhino crashes or a license is checked out and never returned. 
However, you can recover the license manually. 
If the license is in use, it will stay available on the user's computer until Rhino is closed. 

  - Open the Lan Zoo Console
  - Select the license to recover.
  - Pick **Edit** menu and **Recover**
  - The license will now be available.
