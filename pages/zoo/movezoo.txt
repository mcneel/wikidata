======Moving a Zoo Server======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses the steps to moving the Zoo server software from one server to another.//

=====More information=====
Moving the Zoo license manager software from one server to another is no different than installing the Zoo software from scratch.

**Note:** There is no way to //move// or //copy// McNeel product CD-Keys from one Zoo server to another. Add product CD-Keys to the new Zoo server just as you did with your original Zoo server.

=====Steps=====
  - **[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/zoo/6/latest|Download]]** and install the Zoo on a Windows computer.
  - Get all users to close Rhino and all licenses returned to your existing Zoo before your proceed.
  - Make sure **[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/window7firewall|TCP Port 80]]** is open in your firewall.
  - **[[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/zoo/6/latest|Install the latest Zoo]] on the old server** - the newest Zoo will communicate with our license server when you remove licenses, making them available to be added to the new server.
  - Run **ZooAdmin** on the old server
  - Remove your license keys from the old server.
  - Run **ZooAdmin** on the new server 
  - **[[rhinovalidate|Add and validate your license keys]]** on the new server.
  - Redirect your Rhino clients to the new Zoo server by modifying either the Windows Registry or your Domain Name System (DNS) server's default Zoo server name.
  - Uninstall the old Zoo server.

//Note://
  * It is not possible to have a license in two Zoo servers at the same time.
  * If a license is in use, you will not be able to remove it. Use the Zoo's Recover option if you can verify a license is not in use, but still displays checked out. Be aware this will close down any Rhino that has this license in use.
