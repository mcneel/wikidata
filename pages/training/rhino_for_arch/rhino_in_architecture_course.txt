===== Target Audience =====
  * This training is for creative designers working in architecture, digital fabrication, and other building related fields, as well as students in these fields.

===== Course Outline =====
This intensive 6-day class will focus on architectural workflows using Rhinoceros. It will introduce the best practices to maximize productivity and use the rich set of functionality supported by Rhino. It will cover various scenarios for concept modeling and detailed design and visualization. Topics include:

==== Topics ====
  * Modeling methods in architecture: Rhino supports direct and intuitive design to create a wide range of forms and details. Discuss the general approach and how it compares to other modeling methods.
  * Modeling vocabulary: best practices to work productively within the Rhino environment. Introduce topics such as interface, navigation, modeling constraint, visualization and data management.
  * Modeling workflows in architecture: the bulk of the training walks through a few modeling workflows common in architectural design, both in concept design development and detailed modeling.

==== Expected Outcome ====
After this course, the student is expected to be able to:
  * Learn the Rhino modeling environment and different ways to customize it.
  * Learn the Rhino modeling vocabulary and best practices for productivity.
  * Learn modeling workflows in both concept and detailed design.

==== Plug-ins: ====

  * Flamingo nXt 5 rendering plug-in will be used for architecture rendering and site elements like trees.  
  * Lands WIP plug-in will be used for importing terrain, site elements (streetlights, benches, vegetation, trees, etc).
  * VisualARQ will be covered as an alternative to using simply Rhino. Doors and Windows libraries, ease of adding, moving and deleting, automatic stair generation. 2D documents like sections, plans and elevations.
  * Grasshopper for Limited Designer Features
  * PanelingTools for Rhino will be used to populate 2D and 3D patterns.

==== Prerequisites ====

  * Rhinoceros Level 1 or equivalent. We will assume the student can efficiently navigate the Rhino application and model, create curves surface and solids. Edit curves, surface and solids. 
  * Having some familiarity with dimensions, text, and layouts will be beneficial.

==== Expected Outcomes ====
After this workshop the student is expected to be able to:
  * Input and edit curves in imperial and metric units.
  * Generate surface and solids from the curves precisely and in the orientations.
  * Add doors, windows, stairs, decks, railings, and other architectural details into the model.
  * Add materials, lights and render Interior and Exterior with Rhino and Flamingo.
  * Add terrain and trees with Lands Design.
  * Develop a model with VisualARQ.
  * Setup model for presentation in a Layout with dimension, text and rendering.
  * Export 3dm model to variety of software like Google Earth and VR.

=== Project 4: VisualARQ - Architectural Plug-in for Rhino ====
{{ :training:rhino_for_arch:icona-inferior-1.png?300|}}
[[www.visualarq.com|VisualARQ 2 for Rhino]] 

  * Go through any architectural project design process with an intuitive, easy and efficient workflow. Curved walls, free-form surfaces, free-form beams... any complex architectural design is possible.
  * VisualARQ is completely built into the Rhino Interface: Rhino-like menu, toolbars and command’s behavior.
  * It is a powerful feature-based editor to create and edit parametric objects.
  * Cut sections, make plans. No matter how complex your design is. Save time getting all project documentation automatically from the 3D model.
  * Floor plans, sections, elevations, surfaces, dimensions, and all object information are linked to and created from the 3D model.
  * VisualARQ generates documents that combine 2D drawing, 3D models, and additional data tables.
  * Displays in the Top viewport a standard 2D architectural representation of the 3D model in real time.
  * All documentation is dynamically linked to changes in the model.
  * Discuss BIM in VA, dynamic links to Grasshopper, Version 2.0 improvements and more!
