====== Rhino 7 SubD Tutorials ======

> **Summary:** Rhino 7 includes a new Sub-D Geometry Type to allow for more flexible modeling.  Rhino's SubD are accurate and repeatable.  This allows our SubD to be converted to NURBS for fabrication.

=====Introduction to Rhino.Inside Revit=====

In this video Phil Cook from Simply Rhino takes a look at SubD, or Subdivision Surface Modelling, that is being developed for Rhino v7.
 
Traditionally SubD objects are mesh based and lend themselves well to more approximate types of modelling such as character modelling and creating smooth organic forms that are controlled in an approximate fashion. Rhino SubD objects are, however, high precision spline based surfaces and thus introduce a level of accuracy to the process of creating complex freeform shapes. The video starts by examining SubD surfaces and how these compare to NURBS before moving on to look at some examples of how and why SubD can be used alongside the traditional NURBS workflow in Rhino. Simply Rhino are the most popular Rhino3D reseller in the UK, they offer expert training and support for Rhino and all key Rhino plugins.  (37 minutes):

=====From Rhino into Revit=====

| [[https://youtu.be/dP83XnJS6jQ|{{:rhino:inside:revit:rhino_to_revit_-_thumbnail.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | Watch how to transfer information from Rhino to Revit, creating Revit objects from Rhino geometry. See how editing objects in Rhino affects its counterparts in Revit, through this live link without any need to import or export! (3'41") [[https://github.com/mcneel/rhino.inside-revit/tree/master/doc/tutorials/01%20-%20transfer%20rhino%20to%20revit|Download the sample files for this video]]|

=====From Revit into Rhino=====

| [[https://youtu.be/8AjX3YlwjEs|{{:rhino:inside:revit:revit_to_rhino_-_thumbnail.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | In this video, you will learn how to transfer geometry from Revit into Rhino. This is a common workflow used for manufacturing purposes or for 3D printing the model.

=====Using Grasshopper Parameters in Revit=====

| [[https://youtu.be/yDZ4y-ZbBkM|{{:rhino:inside:revit:parameters_in_revit_-_thumbnail.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | In this video, Scott Davidson will show how to use parameters in Revit through Rhino's generative design plugin, Grasshopper. You'll also learn how to use Human UI, a Grasshopper plugin, to create your own dialog boxes that can interact with Revit. (5'31") [[https://github.com/mcneel/rhino.inside-revit/tree/master/doc/tutorials/03%20-%20changing%20parameters%20with%20grasshopper|Download the sample files for this video]]|


=====Interacting with Revit objects=====

| [[https://youtu.be/mYSSoOD3QVM|{{:rhino:inside:revit:interact_with_revit_objects_-_thumbnail.jpg?direct&300 |}}]] | Learn how to reference Revit elements using Grasshopper parameters and output Revit objects. You can edit these objects in Revit and have the Grasshopper freeform geometry update accordingly.

=====Håvard Vasshaug of the Bad Monkeys reviews Rhino Inside Revit=====

| [[https://youtu.be/J11LIrDIchw|{{:rhino:inside:revit:havard-vasshaug.png?direct&300 |}}]] | A 5-star presentation from Håvard Vasshaug of the [[https://www.badmonkeys.net/|Bad Monkeys]] group to Snøhetta. If you know Revit and want to know how your workflow might be improved, watch this. (50'32")|

=====Gavin Crump the Aussie BIM Guru video series on Rhino Inside Revit=====

| [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m2Q905iK-E&list=PLBKwx9iS-LumYizAr4cn0kMEhxGfwU7ls|{{:rhino:inside:revit:rir-aussie-bim-guru2.png?direct&300 |}}]] | [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCry22yTdpgEDdzIZig7NSMQ|Gavin Crump]] kicks off a series on Rhino Inside with a 5 part series - the new tool which connects Rhino and Revit together! Gavin thinks Grasshopper in Revit is a massive breakthrough for computational designers. In this first part, he covers how to bake out elements from Revit into Rhino using filtering criteria. In the next parts we will cover reading and setting parameter values in Revit. (23'52")|

=====Rhino Inside Revit with Geometry Gym ======
|[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m1rn6EAI54&list=PLajD1zxzDkUcq_oEmRWiJP2isEltcUzCG&index=1|{{:rhino:inside:revit:rhino-inside-revit-gg.png?direct&300 |}}]]|This video runs through the basics of Rhino.Inside Revit and how to get up and running with this exciting new technology.  Along with Geometry Gym tools with an eye toward facades and structures.|

=====Parametric Monkey Primer======
|[[https://parametricmonkey.com/2019/11/20/rhino-inside-revit/|{{:rhino:inside:revit:parametric_monkey.jpeg?direct&300 |}}]]|With the release of Rhino.Inside, a whole range of new interoperability possibilities now exist. We've been working with our clients to integrate Grasshopper scripts with Revit, and developed this quick tutorial to help them get up and running. Hopefully it helps you too.[[https://parametricmonkey.com/|Paul Wintour

=====How to Rhino tutorial on Rhino Inside Revit======
|[[https://youtu.be/fEjVrJuR1ik/|{{:rhino:inside:revit:how-to-rir.jpeg?direct&300 |}}]]|This is a short recap of Rhino Inside plugin for Revit which allows Revit and other apps to run Rhino and Grasshopper within Revit application. Keep in mind that this works only with Rhino 7 work in progress version. With this plugin, you can easily import and export geometry from Revit to Rhino and Grasshopper and the other way around. As this is a native McNeel development tool, it is going to be a gamechanger when it comes to having the ability to use parametric modeling techniques in Grasshopper and have all of that work seamlessly in a bim tool such as Revit.

=====Solar analysis with Rhino.Inside.Revit======
|[[https://vimeo.com/363977394|{{:rhino:inside:revit:solar-parametric-monkey.png?direct&300 |}}]]|One of the most frequent requests I receive is about running solar access analysis within Revit. Despite the fact that it is still quicker and more accurate to export to Grasshopper, run the analysis and push the results back, many still prefer to stay within Revit. So I decided to do a quick proof-of-concept and I'm proud to announce that it works perfectly using Rhino.Inside.Revit. [[https://parametricmonkey.com/|Paul Wintour
