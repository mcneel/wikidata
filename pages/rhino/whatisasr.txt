=====Question=====
What is a Service Release?

=====Answer=====
Service releases are no-charge, maintenance releases that patch existing installations of software with the latest bug fixes and updates. These installers are downloadable and will only install if you have a version of the product already installed.  

Service Releases are identified two ways: 
  * the SR number, like SR3 or SR4b.
  * the date, which is coded into the name of the download file like 20050729, meaning July 29, 2005.
