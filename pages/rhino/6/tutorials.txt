=====An Introduction to SubD in Rhino3d v7=====

| [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIbsNurVdb0|{{:rhino:7:tutorial:videos:subd-phil_cook.png?direct&300 |}}]] | In this video Phil Cook from Simply Rhino takes a look at SubD, or Subdivision Surface Modelling, that is being developed for Rhino v7.(37 minutes)|

Traditionally SubD objects are mesh based and lend themselves well to more approximate types of modelling such as character modelling and creating smooth organic forms that are controlled in an approximate fashion. Rhino SubD objects are, however, high precision spline based surfaces and thus introduce a level of accuracy to the process of creating complex freeform shapes. The video starts by examining SubD surfaces and how these compare to NURBS before moving on to look at some examples of how and why SubD can be used alongside the traditional NURBS workflow in Rhino. Simply Rhino are the most popular Rhino3D reseller in the UK, they offer expert training and support for Rhino and all key Rhino plugins.
