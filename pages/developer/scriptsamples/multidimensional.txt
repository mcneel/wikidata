=====Question=====
Why are there two types of multidimentional arrays? What is the difference between the (x)(y) and (x,y) notation?

=====Answer=====
VBScript supports two kinds of multidimensional arrays, called **rectangular** and **ragged**. A rectangular array is, well, rectangular. For example:


<code vb>
 Dim MyArray(3,2) 

</code>
and you get:

   (0,0) (0,1) (0,2)
   (1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
   (2,0) (2,1) (2,2)
   (3,0) (3,1) (3,2)

which makes a nice rectangle. A three-dimensional array makes a rectangular prism, and so on up into the higher dimensions.

A common practice used by [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]] is to simulate multidimensional arrays by making an array of arrays. For example:


<code vb>
 Dim MyArray
 MyArray = Array(Array(1, 2, 3), Array(4, 5), Array(6, 7, 8, 9))

</code>
And so dereferencing the outer array gives you the inner array, which can then be dereferenced itself:

   Rhino.Print MyArray(2)(0) ' 6

But, you notice something about the indices if we write them out as before:

   (0)(0) (0)(1) (0)(2)
   (1)(0) (1)(1)
   (2)(0) (2)(1) (2)(2) (2)(3)

The indices make a ragged pattern, not a straight rectangular pattern. It is possible to create ragged higher dimensional, but allocating all the sub-arrays can be difficult.

Thus, in VBScript if you say:

   MyArray(2,3)

then you are talking to a rectangular two-dimensional array. And, if you say:

   MyArray(2)(3)

then you are talking to a one dimensional array that contains another one dimensional array.
