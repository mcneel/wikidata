** AccuRender 4.0 [[accurender:ar4:sr1|AccurenderSR1]] CD renders slower than AccuRender 3. **

> **Summary:** //The original CD release of AccuRender 4.0 did not support [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2007.//

  * Some AccuRender 4.0 [[accurender:ar4:sr1|AccurenderSR1]] CDs were shipped with a slightly slower rendering core than the SR0 release.  This small patch installer fixes the problem.
