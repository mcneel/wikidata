Relates to [[https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/confusing-v8-print-dialog/181097|Forum Post]]

  - Why are there two drop-down options describing Linetype units? 

  - Can I can apply a multiplier to the line widths I set in the Layer panel?

  - Default line width I assume is to use a width that will override my Layer panel settings?

  - What is **Apply Display Mode Scales**?
