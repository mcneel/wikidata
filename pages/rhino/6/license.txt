While the Rhino End User License Agreement has not changed, we have changed how the usage is enforced in Rhino V6. 

There are now three ways to use your license:
  - Stand-alone used exclusively on a single computer.
  - Floating licenses across a companies private network using the Zoo. [[zoo:home|For more details on setting up a Zoo go here....]]
  - Cloud Zoo For Rhino 6
    - Add your license and it will float to any computer you have access to using the Internet instead of a local area network by logging with your Rhino Account.
    - For multiple users, use the Cloud Zoo to create teams, add multiple licenses, and invite users to join the Team to share the licenses over the internet.

We recommend using Cloud Zoo for maximum flexibility. Details: https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino_accounts/home

You can change from one licensing type to another but it is not automatic.
