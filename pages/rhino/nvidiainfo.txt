====== NVIDIA Quadro Video Issues ======
> **Note:** NVIDIA actively fixes issues and updates their drivers.  Please follow the instructions below to get the latest update. This can have a significant impact on Rhino's stability.

These instructions are for computers that have NVIDIA Quadro graphics hardware. 

**To complete these instructions you must know:**
  - The card manufacturer.  This page is for NVIDIA Corporation cards.
  - The video card model.  This page is for Quadro Models only.
  - The operating system of the computer. [[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-operating-system|Which Windows operating system am I running?]]

If you are not sure of any of these, please go to our **[[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:failure|Rhino Video Troubleshooting]]** section for additional instructions.

> Before updating your video drivers we recommend creating a System Restore point on your computer in case the changes need to be rolled back.  [[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-restore-faq#1TC=windows-7|Instructions for a System Restore.]]
 
=====Determine NVIDIA Quadro driver version=====
  - Start <color red>**Rhino**</color>.
  - On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
  - Expand the **View** tab (located near the bottom of the list on the left), and then click **OpenGL**.
  - Look for the **Driver Version:** line.  It will have a long number that looks like <color grey>x.xx.xxxx.xxxx</color> The last five digits of this number are the NVIDIA driver version. For instance, if the long Driver Version number is 8.17.0011.9713, then the NVIDIA driver version is 197.13.
 
If the NVIDIA graphics driver version is equal to or larger (newer), than 340.66. This was the first driver to work. Most subsequent drivers have been fine.

If the NVIDIA graphics driver version is less than 340.66, or more than 6 months old, then update the driver by following the instructions below.

=====Additional Quadro performance improvements=====

--> NVIDIA Threaded Optimization setting#

Many users are reporting random crashes with NVIDIA drivers.  There is a setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel that seems to help these problems.\\ 

>Note: **We recommend using the "Workstation App - Dynamic Streaming" setting**. The Advanced Streaming option may be a little faster but less stable.

Switching your NVIDIA card to High Performance can also help. Some users have reported this fixes a problem where portions of the **Gumball** feature do not display.
  - Open your NVIDIA Control Panel and select **Manage 3D settings**
  - Then, select the **Power Management mode** and change the option from **Adaptive** to **Prefer maximum performance**
