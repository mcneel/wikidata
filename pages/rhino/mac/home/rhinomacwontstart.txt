{{:rhino:mac:home:error_finding_mac_license.png?400|}}

**Cause:** Enscape created ~/Library/Application Support/McNeel with incorrect permissions.



===== Solution 1: Manually and Complete Uninstall ===== 
**Simplest Solution**

Enscape is the problem. Here's the workaround.
//You have to completely and manually remove Rhino and Enscape. //
This means all the **Rhino** and **Enscape** application, folders and licence keys.

  - In File Finder go to **Applications** and delete: Enscape, Rhino 7 and/or Rhino 8 
  - Now, you will need to manually delete the folders where the plugin files live.
  - In File Finder navigate to: ~/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/MacPlugIns/. Delete **Enscape** plugin folder.  //See more details on uninstalling Mac Plugins// [[https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinocommon/uninstalling-plugins-mac/|here]].
  - Now reset the Rhino licensing files by deleting the contents of these folders:
     - /Users/you/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0/License Manager/Licenses
     - /Users/Shared/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0/License Manager/Licenses
     - And this file if you have it:  
     - /Users/you/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0/ra_cache.txt

  - And while you are in the library, double check to see if there are any Enscape folders and delete them.
  - Restart your Mac
  - Reinstall Rhino. //If your Mac prompts "keep, replace ..." you did not clean up well enough. Go back to the top and try again.//
  - Start Rhino. It should install and open like it was never installed before. And then it will get a license from the RA. 


===== Option 2: Manually modify folder permissions ===== 

  - Quit Rhino completely.
  - Open the **Finder**, click the **Go** menu, hold the **Option** key (⌥) and select **Library**.
  - Open **Application Support** and look for the McNeel folder.
  - Right-click it and select **Get Info**.
  - Go to the **Sharing & Permissions** section and click the padlock to enable editing.
  - Change the permissions to **Read & Write** for all the entries.
  - Click on the options menu at the bottom left of the window (the circle with the three dots) next to the + & - symbols.
  - Select the option **Apply to enclosed items…**
  - Close this menu and start Rhino again.

or 

Please check if you have read & write privileges on these license folders. To do this, right click a folder > choose Get Info > and check the permissions at the bottom of the window that pops up. Make all of them **Read + Write.**
     /Users//Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros
     /Users/Shared/McNeel/Rhinoceros

  - For the User > Library folders, make sure you are in the one from the Go menu in the Finder app when the Option key is held.
  - Start Rhino 8 after making sure you can write to these folders. You should see a Welcome screen to enter your email. If that still doesn't work, try deleting all McNeel folders from both ‘/Application Support’ and ‘/Shared’ before starting Rhino 8
===== Options 3: Use Apple Terminal Commands to Change Folder Permissions =====
**Advanced Skills Required**
 
  - Quit Rhino 8.
  - Restart your Mac.
  - Ensure Rhino 8 is not running.
  - Launch Terminal.
  - Remove the folders that Enscape created.
     - If Rhino 7 is installed and working and you only want to fix Rhino 8, paste into terminal and press Enter:
     - **rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0**
     - Or, paste **rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/McNeel** and press Enter.
  - Start Rhino 8
  - With Rhino successfully starting, now you can reinstall Enscape
  - if you get "permissions denied" as a return when you run the steps above, add the prefix **sudo** then a space, then the command string above. This will call the admin credentials dialog box allowing you to enter admin credentials. Enter admin credentials and the command string should complete successfully. 
  - If all the above fails, you can browse directly to the folder in the finder and delete the folder manually by dragging it into the trash. (confirm with admin credentials) 
  - In some rare cases all the above fails, BUT after a restart the above process finally works. 

or 

Run these command in your Terminal APplication
  sudo mkdir -p ~/.config/.mono/keypairs
  sudo chmod -R 700 ~/.config/.mono/keypairs
We have heard from Enscape that their latest solves the issue.
