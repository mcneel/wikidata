=====Question=====
I have used the Rhino 4.0 Plug-In Wizard to create a Rhino 4.0 plug-In, but it doesn't load into Rhino 4.0. Can you help me to resolve the problem?

=====Answer=====
The Rhino 4.0 SDK includes a debug version of both Rhino (Rhino4_d.exe) and openNURBS (opennurbs_d.dll). The debug version of Rhino is installed in the same location as the production version of Rhino 4.0 (Rhino4.exe).

The Debug project configuration, generated by the V4 project wizard, has been modified so as to be a true Debug configuration, not a "PseudoDebug" configuration as provided in V3. By providing a full Debug version of Rhino and a true Debug configuration, you will be able to get better debugging infomation and hopefully detect more memory leaks.

Also, the V4 project wizard generates a new PseudoDebug configuration which is equivalent to the V3 Debug configuration - Release mode with Debug info. The Release configuration has not changed.

If you build a Debug version of your plug-in, it will only load in the debug version of Rhino (Rhino4_d.exe) installed with the Rhino SDK. If you want to load a plug-in in a release version of Rhino (Rhino4.exe ), you will need to build either a Release or PseudoDebug version of your plug-in.
