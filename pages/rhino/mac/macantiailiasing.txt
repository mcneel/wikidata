====== Antialiasing settings in Mac Rhino ======

Rhino places limits on the highest anti-aliasing setting. These rules were determined from the volume of crashes in the Apple OpenGL drivers or reports of display corruption. Here are the current rules:

==You are limited to a maximum of 4X antialiasing if any of the following are true:==

  * you have a retina laptop
  * you have more than one display
  * your GPU has less than 1024 MB

==You are limited to a maximum of 2X antialiasing if any of the following are true:==

  *you have a retina laptop and an external display
  *your GPU has less than 1024 MB and more than one display
  *your GPU has less than 512 MB

==Anti-aliasing is disabled entirely if:==

  *you have a retina laptop and two external displays
  *you have a retina laptop set to higher than normal resolution
  *your GPU has less than 512 MB and more than one display
  *you have an Intel GPU and it is not a HD 4000 or later

Again, these are performance and stability restrictions based on past performance, and can change at any time.
