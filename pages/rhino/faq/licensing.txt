===== Frequently Asked Questions: Licensing in Rhino 6, Rhino 7 and Rhino 8 =====

====What are my options for licensing Rhino?====
See [[https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/licensing-and-administration|Rhino Licensing options]] for details.

====Sharing Licenses====

==Can I use one license of Rhino on multiple computers?==
Yes, using one of our free-floating license managers. The LAN Zoo works over your office LAN or the Cloud Zoo uses an occasional Internet connection to float single-use licenses between multiple computers.

==What if I want to install using single-computer licensing on multiple computers?==
You'll need a separate license key for each computer. Rhino 5 allowed more than one validation per single-user license key. Rhino 6, 7 and 8 do not. Rhino 6, 7 and 8 adds Cloud Zoo Personal license management so you can take turns using a single license on multiple computers with an occasional Internet connection.

==How can I share one or more licenses with multiple people?==
Add your licenses to a team in the Cloud Zoo (recommended), or add your licenses to the LAN Zoo.

====Upgrading to Rhino 7 ====

==If I upgrade from Rhino 6to 7, can I still use Rhino 6?==
Yes. When you upgrade, you are extending your license to give you access to Rhino 7 features - you are not adding a new license. This means that you can use Rhino 7 and older versions of Rhino on the same computer. You may not use Rhino 6 on one computer while someone else uses the Rhino 7 upgrade on another.

==If I put my Rhino 7 Upgrade license in the Cloud Zoo, can I still install Rhino 6?==
Yes, Rhino 6 can be installed, even if it has been upgraded to Rhino 7. Make sure to have both on the Zoo or Cloud Zoo. 

==Can I put my Rhino 5 license in the Cloud Zoo?==
No. Rhino 5 does not support the Cloud Zoo.

==If I put my Rhino 6 and Rhino 7 Upgrade Licenses in the Zoo, what happens?==
You'll need Zoo 7 SR 7 (or higher) to support Rhino 7 license keys. The Zoo will group your Rhino 6 and Rhino 7 Upgrade keys into a license "cluster", and will make sure only one is in use at any given time. A user who runs both Rhino 6 and Rhino 7 from the same computer will use only one license.

====Using Rhino 7 as a viewer ====

==How can I use Rhino as a viewer only?==

In order to use Rhino as a viewer, you will need an evaluation license key. If you already have one and it's expired, this is perfect for this purpose.  If you don't have any evaluation license, key, ask one on https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/evaluation

When validating your evaluation license, don't choose the option to Share the license between computers, be sure to choose the option to Lock the license on the computer.

In case you already have a license and it's on the CloudZoo, you will have to remove it from your Rhino account first:

  * Go to https://accounts.rhino3d.com/ and login to your account with your email.
  * Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on Licenses and on your name under Personal Licenses.
  * Once removed, launch Rhino 7 again. 
  * When requested to enter a new license choose "Enter your license key" option and type your evaluation license key then click Continue. Make sure that you DO NOT choose the option to "Add To Your Rhino Account" and click on the "Use only on this computer" option on the bottom left and click Yes.  

As long as your Rhino Evaluation license is valid, you will be able to save your work, when it is expired, you will be able to open any Rhino model, change the view, use dimensions, etc. but won't be able to save any file.
