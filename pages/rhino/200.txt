**Solution 1:**
Run a "Repair" on the 64-bit Rhino in Control Panel > Programs and Features to correct the error.

**Solution 2:**
If you have ShapeDiver v1.9.1 for Grasshopper installed, run the TestPackageManager command, and update ShapeDiver to v1.92-beta.1 or above. \\
(ShapeDiver does not cause this error for Rhino 7.)
