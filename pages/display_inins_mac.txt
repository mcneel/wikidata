====== Importing Display Modes to Mac Rhino ======
Display modes can be exported out for Rhino for Windows and imported in Rhino for Mac. 
However, there is one step you may not be aware of. Rhino for Windows export the INI in text format in UTF-16-LE. Programs on the Mac can not read this format. 
After exporting the INI from Rhino for Windows, open in in Notepad and save it as UTF-8 or ASCI. 
Then send it to to your Mac computer and import.
