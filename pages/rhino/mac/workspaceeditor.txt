====== Rhino for Mac Preferences: Commands ======
The **Commands** preferences allows customization of the Rhino workspace.

=== Current command set ===
The **Current command set** specifies the default or customized command set.

=== Customize ===
The **Customize** button opens the **Command Editor** window.

**Note**: The **Default** command set cannot be edited. You must duplicate the command set to create your own.

== To duplicate the command set ==

  - In the **Command Editor** window, in the upper left corner, click a command set name.
  - From the menu, select **Duplicate**. 

The Command Editor allows editing tool palettes and keyboard shortcuts. 
For information about customizing keyboard shortcuts, see [[rhino:mac:keyboardshortcuts|http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/mac/keyboardshortcuts]].

=== Customizing tool palettes ===

The Command Editor is divided into panels.

==== Palette browser ====

In the **Palette browser**, add or remove palettes using the + and - (plus and minus) buttons at the bottom of the browser. A search window is available for searching the palettes. Selecting different palettes in the Palette Browser reveals the contents of the palette in the Palette Contents panel to the right.

==== Palette contents ====

This panel shows the buttons and their commands for the selected Palette. Users can add or remove buttons using the + and - (plus and minus) buttons at the bottom of the Palette Contents panel. Selecting a button in this panel reveals the button’s commands in the Button Info to the right.

==== Button information ====

The Button Info panel shows the commands associated with the selected button. The Button Info panel is divided into two sections: the primary button and the secondary button sections. A given button can run different commands depending on which mouse/trackpad button is pressed (right or left | primary or option). The dropdown Menu: determines that the button is a link to another menu. By adding the button to a menu, a small downward arrow will appear in the bottom right corner of the button.

==== Command browser ====

The Command Browser panel lists all the available buttons (in the current palette set) and their associated commands. Selecting a command in the Command Browser reveals the command in the Command Settings panel to the right.

==== Command settings ====

The Command Settings panel displays all the settings for the selected command. The area at the top is the meta-data associated with the command. The area at the bottom in the Script window shows the contents of the script that is run when the button is clicked.

==== Customize commands ====

Rhino for Mac ships with the Default palette set of commands enabled. When first opening the Command Editor window, the Default command set is active. This command set is Read-Only: it is meant to serve as a sample and a template. 

To create a new command set
  - Select **Duplicate** from the drop-down menu at the upper-left of the Command Editor window.

This creates a new, editable palette set based on the Default command set. You can give this new command set a custom, memorable name based upon your needs.

Your new Custom Palette set is now active in the Palette Browser. You can add a new palette to this set by clicking the + (add button) at the bottom left. You can remove unneeded palette sets by clicking the - (minus) button.
Once you have added a new (empty) palette and select it within the Palette Browser, you will see an empty set of buttons in the Palette Contents panel. To add a new button to this palette, you can either 1) click the + (add button) at the bottom of the Palette Contents panel to create an empty button; or 2) drag a command from the Command Browser to the Palette Contents panel: this action creates a button based on an existing command. You can now edit the commands associated with this button in the Command Settings panel (lower-right).
Select your new command in the Command Browser. Your command should show up in the Command Settings panel at right.
To add a custom image to the command, simply drag and drop the image into the icon area.

For best results, images should be 64 x 64 pixels.
The text, tooltips, help text, and keyboard shortcuts can be added at the top section of the Command Settings panel.

The actual content of the command is entered in the Script text box at the bottom of the

Once changes have been made, you must click the Save button at the lower, right-hand corner of the Command Editor window. You are returned to the Preferences &gt; Commands menu. Now, you must select the Current command set: to your recently created command set. Changes to the interface will only appear in new Rhino modeling windows.
