====== Installing RHI Files for All Users ======
The Rhino Installer Engine installs RHI packages for Rhino. These packages can contain plug-ins, training material, documentation, etc.

The Rhino Installer Engine only installs plug-ins for individual users, not for all users on a computer. To install a plug-in for all users, please do the following:

  - Rename the .RHI file to .ZIP
  - Extract the contents of the .ZIP archive into a folder that is readable by all users on the computer. For example, "C:\Program Files\Rhino Plug-ins\[PLUGIN-NAME]"
  - **Right-click the Rhino icon**, then click **Run as Administrator**
  - From the **Tools** menu, click **Options**, then select the **Plug-ins** tab.
  - Click the **Install** button
  - Browse to the folder where you unzipped the plug-in archive, and select the plug-in RHP file.
  - Close the Options dialog, then close Rhino 5

At this point, the plug-in will be registered for all users on the system.
