====== Can I use Bongo 1.0 normaly while trying out Bongo 2.0? ======
Yes, by using the Bongo Version Selector. 

In the Bongo 2.0 folder in 
**C:\Program Files\Bongo 2.0** 
you will find an exe-file called **BongoVersionSwitch.exe**. Double click on it and you'll be able to choose which Bongo version you want to use, or if you do not want to have Bongo running at all.
