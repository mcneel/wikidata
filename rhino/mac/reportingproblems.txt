====== Reporting Problems with Mac Rhino ======

We want to fix the problems you see, but first we have to duplicate the problem. Below is the information we need from you.

=== Please Add Detail ===
A great bug report includes:
  - How you can make the problem happen. Please include as much detail as possible, even if it seems obvious to you.
  - Describe each step you perform to reproduce the problem. When running commands, note whether you ran a command from the application, or typed a command. Be specific when describing the command you start.
  - Describe what happened after each step.
  - What you wish happened instead. 
  - A model that demonstrates the problem.
  - A screen shot of the problem.
  - A description of your hardware and Rhino version:
    - Open the Rhino Preferences panel.
    - Select the **OpenGL** tab. This displays a description of your computer.
    - Click the **Copy to clipboard** button. This copies the contents of the tab to your clipboard.
    - Paste the copied computer description into the post.

Assume you are the //only// person having the problem.

=== Did Rhino crash? ===

If so, Rhino will present a Crash Report dialog the next time it starts. It is important that you also send the crash file to us.

The Crash Report dialog has a field for describing what you were doing when Rhino crashed. Use the information in this guide when filling out a crash report.

=== Sending a file to us ===

If you have a file that would help us find a problem, you can send the file to us. Go to the [[http://www.rhino3d.com/upload|McNeel File Upload]] web page. Enter your information and use **mactech@mcneel.com** as the recipient address at McNeel, and be verbose in your description of your problem.
