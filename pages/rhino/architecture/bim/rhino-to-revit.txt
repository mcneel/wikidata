====== Rhino to Revit ======

Part of the [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/architecture/home|Rhino in Architecture Series]]

A common workflow is to use Rhino for early design and model exploration. As a project matures, it becomes necessary to export the Rhino models into Revit for further refinement and documentation.  There are many ways to pass models and objects between Rhino and Revit.  Each of the methods below has its advantages and disadvantages.

The main ways to transfer information are as foolows:
  * Using 3D DWG files
  * Using the IFC file format for transfer
  * Rhino > Grasshopper > Dynamo > Revit
  * Read 3DM file in Dynamo, (Mantis Shrimp)
  * Rhynamo
  * Cloud based connections: Flux, Speckle, Konstru

=====Using 3D DWG files====

=====Using IFC to transfer BIM objects to Revit=====

====Upgrading Revit's IFC====
Revit's default IFC reader is not the best IFC reader available for Revit. This may lead to objects within Revit not importing complete family objects. It is recommended to download the upgraded reader for Revit 2017 and Revit 2018.
