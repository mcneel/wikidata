===== General OpenGL Requirements =====

Rhino uses **OpenGL** to display your model in the viewports. The best OpenGL cards for Rhino are designed for “workstation graphics”. We recommend cards with as much video memory as possible. OpenGL card manufacturers regularly publish new drivers. These new drivers always fix known problems, and sometimes introduce new ones. We recommend you **keep your display driver up to date.**

  * Rhino V4 requires OpenGL version 1.1
  * Rhino V5 requires OpenGL version 2.0 and Shader version 1.2

If you have two video cards, please read about [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/twodisplayadapters|using Rhino with two video cards]].

===== Updating Video Drivers =====
<color red> **Warning:**</color> We recommend you create a system restore point before updating your drivers.

  * [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/nvidiainfo|nVIDIA Quadro]] (make sure you have driver version 340.66 or newer)

Do not rely on automatic updates from Windows. Download directly from the manufacture's web site.

===== Manufacturer Information =====
==== Intel Graphics Cards ====
Rhino 5 SR11 runs on **Intel HD3000 and newer** chipsets. Common hardware that includes these newer chipsets are 13" Apple MacBooks and Microsoft Surface Pro tablets. These are not high performance cards. 

==== Pre-HD3000 Intel Graphics Cards ====
Pre-HD3000 Intel graphics chips are **not recommended**

Rhino runs using software emulation on these cards, and may not work properly if you enable hardware acceleration.

To run Rhino with hardware acceleration:

   - In Rhino, Select the Tools menu, then click Options.
   - In the Options dialog box, select the OpenGL tab.

If after testing, your Rhino performance is better than when it is un-check (Software Emulation mode), keep it checked.
Many Rhino 5 features use OpenGL like shaded or rendered display mode and analysis modes.
The performance will not be great using those new features but they may work ok, which might be more desirable than not working at all.

==== nVIDIA Quadro cards ====

These are high-end cards for CAD.\\
Be sure you are running driver version **340.66** or newer.\\

==== Nvidia GeForce ====

The Nvidia GeForce line of GT and GTX line of video cards work well with Rhino.

The GT 200's and 300/s seem quite fast.  nVIDIA FERMI-based GeForce cards (ie. GeForce FX 400 and 500 series) do work, but are not showing the performance increase we would expect from the more expensive cards. In fact, in some cases they have been slower then the 200 or 300 series cards.


==== ATI/AMD ====
**We discourage use of AMD Radeon cards**\\
AMD Radeon HD cards are currently problematic for Rhino 5. They were intended for DirectX graphics only. Video drivers from AMD for the Radeon cards after version 14.4 (December 2013) cause strange artifacts in shaded display modes when Anti-aliasing is enabled.\\
\\
If you have a Radeon, use the older drivers or turn off antialiasing.\\
\\
The FirePro v7900 and v5900 cards are really very good, but their anti-aliasing is not as good as Nvidia.


==== FireGL 5800/7800/8800 ====
Both of these cards are nice. The 5800 is on a bit of the low-end for
FirePros, but it's still a good card. The 7800 is their mid-range FirePro, with the
8800 being their high-end. 

==== Crossfire ====
Running two in Crossfire should only make things better...although I'm not sure if we will see the difference in Rhino.  Crossfire only really reveals itself when things are really pushing the card, like high resolution packed graphics and games requiring high frame rates.   Rhino just doesn't work that way...most of time (like 95%) Rhino's display just sits idle, doing nothing.

===== About Performance Benchmarks =====
Driver writers spend months fine tuning their code in order to get certain benchmarks to yield better results. A given benchmark doesn’t prove anything, all it proves is that that specific benchmark ran better or worse on a specific GPU.

Benchmarks do not show real world usage or performance of the GPU. 
In other words, if one game runs better at some point on a card/GPU, that doesn’t mean that ALL games will now run better on that card. 

It’s more likely that the benchmarks are mentioned or available simply because they were better.
What about all of the other benchmarks where the card failed or was significantly less?

Benchmarks are marketing tools, and are used to position a specific product so that it looks better than competitive products, and are not good measure of real world usage or performance.
