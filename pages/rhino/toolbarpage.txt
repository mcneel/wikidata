The HideGroup toolbar allows you to hide and show individual sets, or groups of objects. Four pre-defined named grouping buttons are provided, as is the ability to create your own named set, or group, of hidden objects.

The ChangeObjectColor toolbar allows you to quickly modify the color of selected objects. Object can be restored to "color by layer" by right clicking on any button.

{{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/James_Isolate_Selection.zip|Isolate/ Unisolate Selection}}
This is a macro w/ Toolbar that functions similarly to the Isolate Selection function in 3DS Max.  It is quite useful when you want to work on an individual section of a model without dealing with layer assignments or visibility settings.  Note: Unisolate will only show objects hidden when the isolate command is invoked, so you don't need to worry about all of your hidden objects coming back.

{{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/Grid.zip|Les's Grid/Snap Toolbar}}
I have to admit I am a grid snapping freak, so I use the grid tools a lot. So I made a toolbar where you can quickly adjust the grid spacing and the snapping in all viewports at once. The tooltip will list 3 numbers when you hover over the grid spacing buttons:

Minor Spacing / Major Spacing / Grid Extents (eg, 10/50/500)
