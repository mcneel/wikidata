=====Question=====
I am trying to install the LAN Zoo server onto a different disk drive. I tried to install LAN Zoo via **msiexec.exe** to another path, but it always was installed in //Program Files//.

=====Answer=====
Here is the proper syntax to install the LAN Zoo to an alternative location.

  msiexec /i <msi_file> INSTALLLOCATION=<pathspec>
  
For example, this syntax will install Zoo 5 SR6 to the **D:\Progs\Zoo** folder.

  msiexec /i zoo50_5.6.30918.07015.msi INSTALLLOCATION=D:\Progs\Zoo

\\
