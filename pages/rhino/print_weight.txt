===== When I print to the printer or plotter my lines are very faint.  How do I assign print widths to my Rhino model? =====
  * **Print widths** are available for 2D object like curves (line, circles, arc, freeform), hatch, text and dimensions.
  * **Print widths** are __not__ available for 3D objects like surfaces and polysurface.
In Rhino, you can assign print widths in 3 ways:

1. Assign the **print width** to the layer.

2. Assign the **print width** to the object property.

3. Assign the default **print width** in the Print dialog.

To view your **print width** before printing, use the PrintDisplay command, and set the State to ON.

  Command: PrintDisplay
  Print Display (Model Viewports) ( State=Off  Color=Print  Thickness=40 ): State
  State <Off> ( On  Off  Toggle ): ON

You can also toggle this from the right click menu.
