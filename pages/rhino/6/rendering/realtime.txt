=====Overview=====


Rhino 6 includes advanced realtime rendering modes. Use these modes to create quick high-quality renderings for design presentation.  For a basic understanding of realtime rendering in Rhino V6 watch this video (3 minutes):

=====Setting up a rendering=====


| [[https://vimeo.com/259726371|{{:rhino:6:rendering:getting-started-realtime.png?direct&300 |Setting up a rendering}}]] | Getting started setting up a rendering is the first step. Here, Kyle covers basic material creation and assignment, the first step in any rendering. \\ (11 minutes) |

=====Additional render settings=====

There are many setting that can be changed to improve the rendering. Take a tour through some of the settings beyond the defaults. 

===Environment===

If you do not like the reflections or would like to see the model in a different scene, change the environment.

===Groundplane===

Rhino 6's new groundplane features can really create a good based to build your rendering from.

===Snapshots===

| [[https://vimeo.com/259775564|{{:rhino:6:rendering:snapshots-v6.png?direct&300 |Use Snapshots to assemble the model}}]] | Snapshots allow multiple views and model configurations to be saved for future reference. Use snapshots to create multiple graphical presentations of the same model. \\ (6 minutes) |

===Saving an image from the Display modes===

=====Decals=====

Decals are textures and images placed on the model in a specific location.  Normally these images are placed in a very specific location.  Kyle covers both basic and intermediate ways of using decals on the model.

| [[https://vimeo.com/259779341|{{:rhino:6:rendering:basic-decal-v6.png?direct&300 | Get started using decals in Rhino 6}}]] | Get started using decals to place images and textures in very specific places on the model.  A great way to paint certain parts of a model. \\ (5 minutes) |

| [[https://vimeo.com/259885405|{{:rhino:6:rendering:advanced-decal-v6-png.png?direct&300 | Use the new advanced decal engine in Rhino 6}}]] | Learn how to manage multiple decals on multiple objects in this presentation about Rhino 6's new decal tools.  |

=====Raytrace Mode=====

Beyond Rhino 6's new render diaplay mode is the new raytrace display mode. This is a new almost realtime raytrace mode in the viewport.

| [[https://vimeo.com/259905129|{{:rhino:6:rendering:raytrace-mode-v6.png?direct&300 | Use the new advanced raytrace engine in Rhino 6}}]] | Kyle covers the new raytrace display mode and how to get the most out of this new raytrace render mode. \\ (8 minutes) |

| [[https://vimeo.com/259909945|{{:rhino:6:rendering:focal-blur-v6.png?direct&300 | Focal blur in the new advanced raytrace engine in Rhino 6}}]] | Focal blur can be used to add depth and realism to the raytrace view rednerings.  Learn how best to use this new feature. \\ (2 minutes) |

| [[https://vimeo.com/259911829|{{:rhino:6:rendering:glass-raytrace-mode.png?direct&300 | Raytrace mode may need a quick edit to the glass}}]] | Raytrace display mode in Rhino may require a change in the glass material.  Here is a quick way to change the glass to look great. \\ (1 minutes) |

| [[https://vimeo.com/259917090|{{:rhino:6:rendering:raytrace-display-settings.png?direct&300 | Raytrace mode system settings}}]] | Raytrace display mode also can be configured to take advantage of advanced hardware.  See this video on how to change the raytrace display mode default. \\ (1 minutes) |
