=====Background=====

Rhino 6 now has many more advanced display options that can be configured to create more advanced, realtime display modes. There are many default modes.  Additional modes can be created and customerized to create many new effects in the display. A display mode can control shadows, edge thickness, materials and lighting. 

For a basic understanding of default display modes in Rhino, go to:
