====== Some Display Features Are Missing ======


First, simply ** [[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting|updating video drivers]]** may help.

Second, make sure **hardware acceleration** is enabled in the //Options > View > OpenGL// page. 

If you are still missing expected features like cast shadows or reflections in the viewport display, here are a couple of things to check.

  * **Cast shadows:** Are shadows enabled in the display mode for this viewport? Check the **Display panel** (//Panels  menu > Display//)  and make sure the **Shadows** box is checked.

  * **Reflections:** Rhino can show environment reflections in the viewport if object materials have some reflectivity set. Reflections may not look like much if the environment is a flat color or a simple gradient. Setting a more //active// environment in the **Environment panel**  (//Panels  menu > Environment//) will give these surfaces something more to reflect.
