======V5 Crashes in Splash and About======
Some HP's notebook and laptop computers use a fingerprint scanning product developed by DigitalPersona, that causes Rhino V5 to crash when using the Splash and About tool. This same tool causes button tooltip problems on flyout toolbars on Rhino 4.0.

In the V4 case we got from a user on 21-Jan-2011 was a "HP TouchSmart tm2-2012tx". It has "HP SimplePass Identity Protection" installed that installs applications from DigitalPersona. The application causes the problem is "**C:\Program Files (x86)\DigitalPersona\Bin\DPAgent.exe**". To solve the problem, you can turn the "**DpAgent.exe *32**" off from Windows Task Manger and rename it with a different name to make it not run automatically when Windows starts.
