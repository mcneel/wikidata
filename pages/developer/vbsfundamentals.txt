=====Overview=====

VBScript (short for Visual Basic Scripting Edition) is an easy-to-use scripting language developed by Microsoft that enables authors to create powerful tools using a subset of the Visual Basic language. VBScript is implemented as a fast, portable interpreter for web browsers and applications that use ActiveX controls and OLE Automation servers.

If you already know Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), VBScript will be familiar. Even if you do not know Visual Basic, it should not take you long to get up-to-speed. VBScript is a relatively easy language to learn and use.

RhinoScript is a plug-in for Rhino that implements active scripting. Besides providing support for VBScript, RhinoScript also runs as an OLE automation server that exposes the internal workings of Rhino to automation.
