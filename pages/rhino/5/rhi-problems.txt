-->Package not compatible#
There are a few possible reasons this error can occur. The most likely are first:
  - **Incorrect File Associations:** 
    - Download and run [[http://files.mcneel.com/rhino/6.0/RhiFix.exe|RhiFix.exe]]
    - If the fix does not work, please send the following to support@mcneel.com:
      * A screenshot of the error
      * Repair Utility log (all the text below RECOMMENDED ACTION)
      * The RHI installer log. Here is where you find it in V5, V6 or V7:
        - Rhino 5: `%appdata%\mcneel\rhinoceros\5.0\logs`
        - Rhino 6: `%appdata%\mcneel\rhinoceros\6.0\logs`
        - Rhino 7: `%appdata%\mcneel\rhinoceros\7.0\logs`

  - **Old Rhino 5:** attempting to install Grasshopper into Rhino V5 SR0 can generate this error. Update your Rhino 5 to the current service release to fix this problem.
  - **Corrupt Download:** a corrupt RHI file that cannot be installed. This often is the result of an incomplete download. Please delete the RHI file, clear your web browser's temporary files, and download again.
  - **Poorly Authored RHI:** if you are a developer, you may have not properly created the RHI file. Please review instructions for [[developer/rhinoinstallerengine/authoring|authoring RHI files]].
