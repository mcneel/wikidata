=====BACKGROUND=====
\\

Panels are repeated patterns on surfaces, polysurfaces or a grid of points.  [[labs:panelingtools|PanelingTools]] offer two ways to create panels.  The first is to use an ordered paneling grid of points (ordered by row and column) and the second is by objects ([[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] surface or polysurface). Panels are added in the form of edges, faces borders, face patches, flat faces and a mesh. All panels are serialized.

\\

[[labs:panelingtools|PanelingTools]] use some geometry concepts such as [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] curves and surfaces, the U and V direction of a [[rhino:nurbs|NURBs]] surface, trimmed vs untrimmed surfaces and polysurfaces.  For a quick review, you can check the [[rhino:nurbssurfaces|NurbsSurfaces]] wiki page.

\\

**Paneling by ordered grid of points:**

  * Step one: Create an ordered grid of points
Points must be ordered in rows and columns.  Each point location is marked in its object name (shows in the object properties).

//Syntax is: Name(intRow)(intColumn)//

{{:legacy:en:pt_top.PNG}}

While [[labs:panelingtools|PanelingTools]] offers many commands to create the ordered grid, users can create their own, through scripting for example.  All that is required is to name point-objects and use for paneling.

Another advantage of separating grid generation from paneling is that users can edit the grid before paneling.  They can run commands like pull, project or transform to edit the grid, then panel.

  * //Step two: Create panels//
Select an ordered point grid, a reference object (optional), pattern and the kind of output you like to get.  Custom paneling and quads is also possible.

\\

**Paneling surfaces and polysurfaces directly:**

These are tools to panel directly using a reference surface or polysurface.

It is also possible to combine grid generation commands with paneling by grid commands using macros.  Here is an example where you can have a PanelByGridArray:

//ptGridArray //Pause //Pause //ptPanelGrid _Enter

=====COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS=====

\\

=====Toolbars=====
[[labs:panelingtools|PanelingTools]] toolbars offer two sets of scripted commands that combine grid generation with paneling. Toolbars are available for download.

=====Menu=====
Note that [[labs:panelingtools|PanelingTools]] drop-down menu shows only after [[labs:panelingtools|PanelingTools]] is loaded (usually after calling one of the plugin commands for the first time in a session).

Input grid u and v directions, base point, and u and v spacing.  Using input, a base grid is created.  Input points are rounded to the closest grid intersection points. This is why the result might be fewer points then the input (multiple points can be rounded to same index).  For random set of points, the higher the spacing, the more successful it will be to panel these points as illustrated in the image below.

If align option is set to “Yes”, points will shift location slightly to align with the defined spacing.

   U_Spacing: Reference grid spacing in the first direction.
   U_Direction: Option to set first direction
   V_Spacing: Reference grid spacing in the second direction
