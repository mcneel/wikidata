===== Random crashing with Nvidia cards - Nvidia Threaded Optimization setting =====

Several users are reporting random crashes with updated Nvidia drivers.  Jeff recently discovered a setting in the Nvidia Control Panel that seems to be causing this problem.  Nvidia says it should normally be turned off, but many users are finding the control turned on instead.

> <color slategray>**Update:** //on 7-Nov-08, John (<jrharvey5923@gmail.com>) reported on the Rhino Newsgroup that there are no longer problems with threaded optimization in the newest drivers (ver. 180.42). Also these drivers reportedly allow multi-monitors on SLI computers.//</color>

> <color slategray>**Update:** //on 18-Nov-08, John Brock (<jb@mcneel.com>) is running a [[rhino:geforce|GeForce]] 9800 GTX with driver version 7.15.11.7813 (9/17/2008) and has the random crash problem with threaded optimization set to "auto".  Set to off eliminates the problem.//</color>
