=====Introduction to Layouts in Rhino 5=====
This can be also be used with **Rhinoceros 6 for Windows**. Differences are minor between 5 & 6. See [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/layouts6tips|Tips for Using this Layout Tutorial in Rhino 6.]] 
//This will be updated for Rhino 6. We will let you know when it is done.//

Need to know about Layouts in **Rhino for Mac**, look [[https://vimeo.com/178427299|here.]]
====What is a Layout?====

The Layout is used to arrange, annotate, and plot the model. Layouts are designed to do the following:
{{ :rhino:anno_layout_tutorial1.png?300|}}

      * Arrange views of the model, called details, at different scales and orientations.
      * Add annotations like title blocks and general notes to the layout.
      * Assign scales to the details and plot the layout 1=1.
      * Create text, dimensions in the details or on the layout.
      * Use Annotation Scaling for text, dimensions, and hatch.
      * Control layer visibility and color per detail.
      * Plot one, some or all the layouts to a plotter, printer or PDF.

==== Background ====

There were no Layouts in Rhino 3 and earlier versions.  The task of arranging multiple views of the model on a title block was done outside of Rhino with other CAD software. 
Rhino 4 added the Layout space, and Rhino 5 improves it in the following ways:

**New commands**
  * Draw Order controls the order the Detail Views are drawn in a Layout. 
  * DisableClippingPlane - Turns off selected clipping planes in the active viewport. Also available in Properties -> Clipping Plane pane.
  * ImportLayout - Imports layout pages from another Rhino file.
  * Multipage Layout Print - Any or all the layouts can be printed at once.
  * ShowLayersInDetail - Shows layers in detail views.
  * HideLayersInDetail - Hides the selected layers in detail views.
  * ShowSelectedInDetail - Works just like the ShowSelected command except it only works on objects that were previously hidden with the HideInDetail command.
**Enhancements**
  * HideInDetail - New options added to include/exclude the active and inactive details.
  * Text and Dimension style scaling - Text and dimension can be now scaled differently in layout viewports and model viewports. This makes it easier to have text and dimension appear at the same height in different viewports when they are at different scales in a layout.
  * Hybrid printing - When possible, both raster and vector printing are used to make higher quality prints.

==== Support files ====
Here are the files required for both the PDF tutorials and the video tutorial below.

===== Layout tutorial for Rhino 5 (PDF)=====

This tutorial steps you through the setup of a model to plot from a Sheet Layout viewport. You can download these files and work along with the tutorial.

In this tutorial, we:
  - Use the Layout feature to create a plot sheet with details and title block. 
  - Set the scale to the details and add text and dimensions that are sized correctly to the detail. Use layer visibility per detail and set layer color per detail.
  - Annotate the plot sheet with title block, notes, and other objects that are not directly related to the model. 
  - Assign print width, print color to objects, and enable the Print Preview mode. 
  - Plot the layout 1:1 or full size to a PDF.
