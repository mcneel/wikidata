====== Rhino 5: Error Rhino is unable to connect to ZooClient.dll ======
**Problem:**\\ Rhino 5 shows a message "**Rhino is unable to connect to ZooClient.dll. Rhino will not run**" when it is run. In the several known cases, this problem seemed to only happen with Rhino 5 64-bit on Windows 8. Rhino 5 32-bit was not affected in these cases.\\ {{http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/rhino/5/zooclient_dll.png}}


**Cause:**\\ Rhino 5 doesn't have enough permission privileges to interact with the ZooClient.dll.

**Solution 1:**
  - Download and install the V5 full installer from http://www.rhino3d.com/download This includes an **updated installer**. The original DVD release of Rhino V5 did not include these improvements.

**Solution 2:**
  - Right-click on the Rhino 5 shortcut icon on the desktop and select **Properties**.\\ <color #999999>The changes will be applied to the Rhino 5 executable, not the shortcut itself.</color> 
  - On the **Compatibility** tab, select **Windows 7 compatibility mode**.
  - Eable **Run this program as an administrator**.\\ {{http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/rhino/5/rhino5x64properties.png?300}}
  - Click **OK**.
