===== Issue =====
I am trying to get the Zoo running on Windows XP. As soon as we start the Zoo on that machine, the Zoo freezes up, and nothing happens. Isn't Windows XP supported for Zoo 5?

===== Resolution =====
Zoo 5 is supported on **Windows XP Service Pack 3**. 

Zoo 5 requires **Microsoft .NET Framework 4**.

The Zoo installer does not include this framework, as it would add about ~50 MB to the download.
