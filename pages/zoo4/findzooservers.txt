===== Question =====
My organization is using the Zoo to manage it's Rhino 4.0 licenses. But, nobody around here seems to know what computer the Zoo server is running on. How can I discover this?

===== Answer =====
The **SetZooServer.exe** utility, one of the Zoo Bonus Tools, not only assists in configuring workstations for Registry Key lookup. It also will search your network for Zoo servers. This is a great way to find out were your Zoo servers are.
