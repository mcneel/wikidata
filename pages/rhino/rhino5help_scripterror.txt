{{:rhino:error_in_rhino_5_help.png?600|}}

=====Answer=====
This issue Is related to the Flash player being discontinued. 
To solve this issue you will need internet connection and to do the following:

  - Delete the local **help chm** that uses Flash video clips. (this path is displayed in the error dialog.) 
  - When the **chm** is missing, Rhino will load help from the web that uses mp4 video clips.
