> **Summary:** //What to do when DotNET plugins fail to load.//

=====Introduction=====

Since Version 3, Rhino has supported DotNET plugins. Since Rhino4 this implementation is very complete and robust, however some problems remain. This page treats the known issues and possible solutions.

=====Language setting issue=====

DotNET plugins failed to load on Windows versions with certain language packs (such as Turkish). A fix for this issue is available for Rhino4 SR1.

\\

=====Remote path issue=====

If a DotNET plugin is not located on the local hard drive (I.e. if it is loaded over a network) it will not load. A fix for this issue is available for Rhino4 SR1.

=====General loading problems=====

If you're still running into problems, you can enable a hidden command in Rhino which creates a report on the loading process:

\\

  - Close all Rhino instances.
  - Start a new instance of Rhino.
  - Run the command _TestDotNetMessages
  - You should see the following message:  <color blue> Rhino.NET plug-in manager debug messages enabled. You must restart Rhino for this effect to take place.</color>
  - Restart Rhino and attempt to load the plugin again.
  - Now, there will be information printed in the command line whenever a DotNET plugin is loaded.
  - Use the _TestDotNetMessages command again to disable DotNET loading reports.
