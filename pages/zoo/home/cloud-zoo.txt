====What is the Cloud Zoo?====

A cloud-based license management system that:
   - Allows you to use Rhino by logging into the Cloud Zoo using your Rhino Account.
   - Keeps track of the licenses you own. www.rhino3d.com/licenses
   - Allows you to track and manage members of a team. www.rhino3d.com/licenses
   - Allows you to use Rhino on multiple machines as long as you abide by the [[http://files.na.mcneel.com/rhino/5.0/docs/rh50_eula.pdf|license agreement]].

The Cloud Zoo is a new option to license Rhino. It can replace the existing license key system or Zoo, or you can continue to use the previous licensing method. 

===Preliminary Requirements===

  * Rhino 6.0. or Rhino 7.0. 
  * A Rhino Account (Create one at [accounts.rhino3d.com] (https://accounts.rhino3d.com)).
  * A Rhino 6 or 7 license validated with any email address associated with your Rhino Account.
  * An Internet connection when choosing to Login (you can disconnect afterward).

===Benefits===
  - No need to deal with license keys when using Rhino.
  - Use Rhino on multiple machines with ease.
  - Rhino keeps working when you're not connected to the Internet (an infrequent connection is required).

====How to Use the Cloud Zoo:====

  - In the  **Licensing** dialog box, enter your email address, then select **Login**.
  - Log in to your Rhino Account when prompted, and grant access for Rhino to access the requested information from your account.
