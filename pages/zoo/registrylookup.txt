=====Question=====
I am running Rhino 4.0 on an x64-based verison of Windows, and I cannot get Rhino to find a Zoo using Registry Key Lookup. What gives?
=====Answer=====
Computers that are running an x64-based version of Windows use a different registry layout to handle both 32-bit and 64-bit programs.

Native mode 64-bit programs run in Native mode and access keys and values that are stored in the following registry sub key:

<code>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software
</code>

32-bit programs run in WOW64 mode and access keys and values that are stored in the following registry sub key:

<code>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\WOW6432node
</code>

Rhino 4.0 is a 32-bit application. Thus, if Rhino 4.0 is running on an x64-based version of Windows, you will want to add the Zoo Registry Key Lookup entry in this location:

<code>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\WOW6432node\McNeel\RhinoLM
</code>

=====Zoo Bonus Tools=====
If you are using the Zoo on routed networks and Rhino is unable to find the Zoo, then the Zoo lookup, either Registry Key or DNS, may not be configured correctly. You might see if one of the Zoo Bonus Tools can assist in resolving the problem. The Zoo Bonus Tools include the following utilities:

  - **SetZooServer.exe** - Assists in configuring workstations for Registry Key lookup.
  - **ZooDnsResolver.exe** - Assists in testing the DNS Lookup feature.
