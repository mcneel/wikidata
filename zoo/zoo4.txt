=====Getting Started=====
  * Download and install **[[http://download.rhino3d.com/zoo/4.0/release/download/|Zoo 4.0]]** on a Windows-based server or workstation.
  * Install Rhino, Flamingo, Penguin, Brazil, and Bongo on any or all of the computers in your network as workgroup nodes. 
  * The Zoo is designed to work right out of the box - there is no configuring necessary other than adding your licenses (CD-Keys), and then configuring these products to run as workgroup nodes.
  * From the Zoo **Edit** menu, select **Add** and type the CD-Keys.
  * License key numbers (CD-Keys) are located inside the back cover of the application User's Guide or in the front of the CD case. 
  * Tip: Put all your CD keys into a text file with one on each line. Use **File -> Import** to import them into the Zoo.
  * See the Zoo Help file for additional details. 

=====Limitations=====
Rhino 5 is not supported by Zoo 4.0. If you have Rhino 5, you will need to use [[http://download.rhino3d.com/Zoo/5.0/release/download/|Zoo 5]].
