====== Crash When Browsing for a DWG File ======

Rhino 4.0 and 32-bit Rhino 5 crash while trying to browse for a .dwg file from the Open, Insert, Import, Save, SaveAs, or Export commands.

=====Cause=====

Your computer has
  * 64-bit Windows Vista or 64-bit Windows 7. 
  * AutoCAD 2005, 2006 or 2007. (AutoCAD prior to 2008 does not detect the mode of the OS and installs as a 32 bit application.)

AutoCAD 2005, 2006 or 2007 installs a shell extension called **AcSignIcon.dll**. This shell extension loads into Rhino's File Open dialog box. This shell extension often causes Rhino to crash while browsing for **.dwg** files.

=====Solution=====

Disable the AcSignIcon.dll Shell Extension:

  - Download {{:rhino:disableacsignicon.zip|DisableAcSignIcon.zip}}.
  - Extract DisableAcSignIcon.reg.
  - Double-click DisableAcSignIcon.reg, and follow all the prompts to allow the .reg file to modify the settings on your computer.
