=====Installer Error: Windows cannot open the file=====
**Cause:** Windows doesn't have the file associations set correctly for Rhino RHI files.

**Solution:**

  - In Control Panel, open **Programs and Features**.
  - Right-click **Rhinoceros 5**, then click **Repair**.
  - Right-click **Rhinoceros 5 64-bit**, then click **Repair**.
  - Double-click your RHI installer to install.

If this doesn't work, please follow the instructions for **Manually associating RHI files**.

=====Installer RHI not compatible with Rhino=====
There are a few possible reasons this error can occur. The most likely are first:
  - **Old Rhino V5:** attempting to install Flamingo into Rhino V5 SR0 can generate this error. Update your Rhino 

V5 to the current service release to fix this problem.
  - **Corrupt Download:** a corrupt RHI file that cannot be installed. This often is the result of an incomplete download. Please delete the RHI file, clear your web browser's temporary files, and download again.

=====Rhinoceros 5.0 file open error=====
**Cause:** Somehow, Rhino 5 was incorrectly associated with RHI files.

**Solution:** Follow the instructions for **Manually associating RHI files** below.

**On 64-bit Windows**
  - Right-click a Rhino Installer Package (RHI) file, then click **Open with...**
  - In the Open with dialog box, select the **Always use the selected program to open this kind of file** checkbox.
  - In the Open with dialog box, click **Browse...**
  - Browse to //C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System\x64// then select **rhiexec.exe** (If you installed Rhino in a different location, browse to that location).
  - Click **Open**.
  - Click **OK**.

**On 32-bit Windows**
  - Right-click a Rhino Installer Package (RHI) file, then click **Open with...**
  - In the Open with dialog box, select the **Always use the selected program to open this kind of file** checkbox.
  - In the Open with dialog box, click **Browse...**
  - Browse to //C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5\System\x86// then select **rhiexec.exe** (If you installed Rhino in a different location, browse to that location).
  - Click **Open**.
  - Click **OK**.


=====Installing Flamingo NXT from a CD=====
**//Problem://** You run the installer and get an error that Rhino 4 SR9 or Rhino 5 must be installed. Except .... Rhino 5 is already installed.

{{ :flamingo:nxt:nxtnoinstall.jpg?nolink&380 |}}

**//Answer://** This is a problem related to early DVDs built before Rhino 5 was available.  To fix this problem, 

Download a new DVD installer: [[http://www.flamingo3d.com/download/nxt/release|New DVD installer for Flamingo]]

<color darkgrey>**Note** This is a large download. It may take a long time to download.</color>

===Another option====
If you do not have time to download the new Flamingo DVD Installer above, you can work around the issue by installing Rhino 4 SR9 Eval. You do not need to use it, but uninstalling is also not recommended. Download the Rhino 4 English SR9 25 save eval (03-09-2011) [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.na.mcneel.com/rhino/4.0/2011-03-09/eval/rh40eval_en_20110309.exe|here.]]


=====Flamingo installation fails with 1603 error=====
**//Problem://** You try to install Flamingo nXt and receive this 1603 error and the install fails.

**//Answer://** Download and install the [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5/latest?PageSpeed=noscript|Rhino 5 32-bit eval]].
 
**//Why?//** 
This will happen on computers that do not have Rhinoceros 4 or Rhino 5 32-bit. Currently the Flamingo nXt installer looks for a component in these versions and will not install. As a workaround, install the Rhino 5 32-bit Evaluation. 


=====Flamingo is installed, but will not run=====
**//Problem://** You run Flamingo nXt in Rhino 5 and receive an error that reads: 

>Flamingo Initialization Error- Unable to communicate with the license manager

**//Answer://** It is likely that the license manager for Flamingo has been deleted by the Rhino 4 uninstaller.  Please install one of the two files below to fix this problem:

[[http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.na.mcneel.com/flamingo/nxt/2011-03-09/release/rhinolm_20110309_x86.exe|Flamingo License manager for 32-bit Windows]]

[[http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.na.mcneel.com/flamingo/nxt/2011-03-09/release/rhinolm_20110309_x64.exe|Flamingo License manager for 64-bit Windows]]


=====Flamingo does not load with a Rhino plug-in error=====
**//Problem://** When starting up Rhino you receive this error:

>Rhino Plug-in Error for FlamingonXtNet64.rhp – A procedure imported by ArNxtToolkitDotNet64.dll could not be loaded.  

**//Answer://** Normally this is a service release for Flamingo that did not install properly.  Uninstall the last service release using this method:

  - Uninstall Flamingo patch. You can do this in Control Panel.
  - Highlight the Flamingo nXt program and look in the upper left corner. There is an option in the left margin to //View installed updates.//
  - Pick it, and from the next list highlight Flamingo nXt 3.1.2012.10.18.
  - Right click and pick Uninstall. (You can also uninstall the entire Flamingo program, but you will need to reinstall from the CD.)
  - Now open Rhino. Flamingo should load. Tell me what version of Flamingo you now have.
  - Close Rhino and install the 9-11-2012. You now get it from here.
