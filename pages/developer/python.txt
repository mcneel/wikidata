=====What is Python?=====

Python is a modern //programming language//. It is easier to learn and use than other non-scripting style languages like VB.NET, C#, or C++. Yet it is quite powerful. 

You may need Python if you want to:

  * Automate a repetitive task in Rhino much faster than you could do manually.
  * Perform tasks in Rhino or Grasshopper that you don't have access to in the standard set of Rhino commands or Grasshopper components.
  * Generate geometry using algorithms.
  * Many, many other things. It is a programming language after all.

=====Windows and Mac=====
Both the Windows and Mac versions of Rhino contain support for the [[http://www.python.org|Python]] scripting language.

Since Rhino Python scripting is available on both platforms, the same Python scripts can run on both //breeds// of Rhino!

=====Python in Rhino resources=====
**RhinoScript style functions** - Once you understand a bit about Python, importing the rhinoscriptsyntax module will give your Python script access to Rhino functions. This package defines a large set of functions for working with Rhino. Find more information about these functions at [[rhinoscriptsyntax]].

**Using RhinoCommon** - Python scripts also have full access to the .NET framework including access to Rhino's RhinoCommon SDK.  A description of accessing RhinoCommon from Python scripts is at [[PythonAndRhinoCommon]].

**Examples** - Find examples in the above [[rhinoscriptsyntax]] and [[PythonAndRhinoCommon|RhinoCommon]] pages.

=====Questions?=====
Visit the http://discourse.mcneel.com/category/scripting to get answers from the Rhino development team and other Rhino users with scripting experience.


=====What about RhinoScript?=====
Rhino already has a scripting language called [[rhinoscript|RhinoScript]]. We plan to continue supporting RhinoScript and add functions based on requests.
