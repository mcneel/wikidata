====== The profession of Architects who design floating structures ======

======Naval Architecture======

[[rhino:rhinoceros|RhinoCeros]] is an excellent tool to visualise the vision of the Naval Architect.

Originally mankind created floating structures from trees for example. Later on several cultures developed shipbuilding techniques by combining different materials into a vessel, such as the canoe or cayak. Then people started to build ships from moulds which standardised the hullform. Things really changed when someone used a pencil to draw a ship on paper and converted this drawing into a lines plan and construction plan. The computer aided the designer at first by drawing the 'lines on the screen'. The Naval Architect had a 3d hull form in his mind and made a conversion in his head to a 2d drawing which he or she put on the computer screen.

With the evolution of computer technology it became possible to realise 3d design immediately into the computer. [[rhino:rhinoceros|RhinoCeros]] is a tool which makes this possible. Also new manufacturing techniques make it possible to manufacture immediately in 3d. For example computer controlled routers or 3d printers.
