===== Question =====
As described on your website, we installed the Zoo on VMWare Fusion Pro / Windows 7 on our Mac OS X server. For whatever reason, it just does not work. From Rhino, we have tried both the automatic detection and specifying the servers IP address. Rhino just reports, //An unknown exception has occurred. Please contact your system administrator for assistance.//

===== Answer =====
Keep in mind that you not just running Windows 7, you running it as a virtual machine under OS X. So there will be additional network configuration required to make all this work.

A couple of links that are worth reading:

[[http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1022264|Understanding networking types in VMware Fusion]]

[[http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2006955|Configuring a Web server on a virtual machine that uses NAT mode networking]]

You can also find more information by searching the web for "Run Web Server on VMWare Fusion", keeping in mind that the Zoo users TCP Port 80 just like a web server.

Depending on what your Mac server is doing and how many other VM sessions it support, configuration might be very simple or a little more involved.

For example, if your Mac server does not host any web services and only runs a single VMWare session, then all you need to do is configure the session's network adapter for "Bridged" mode. This is the simplest way to get the Zoo to work on VMWare. 

If you need the network adapter configured for NAT, then you will need to configure VMWare for port forwarding.
