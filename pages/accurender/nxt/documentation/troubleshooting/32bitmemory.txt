===== Complex Rendering Fails on 32-Bit System =====

nXt is a memory-intensive application which may exceed the limitations of a 32- bit system under certain situations.  When these limitations are approached or exceeded nXt may become unstable.  These situations include, but are not limited to:

  - Complex geometry (either a lot of objects or objects which generate many faces)
  - nXt Plants
  - High resolution rendering
  - Use of Lighting Channels
  - High resolution textures

Avoiding or reducing some of these cases may allow you to render your scene.

**3GB Memory Switch**

Windows does include a system switch for making more memory available to 32-bit processes. Instead of a 2GB limitation, you can increase the limitation to 3GB by following [[rhino:memoryincrease|this procedure]]. Doing so may allow you to render your scene, although some scenes will still be too complex to render in 3GB.


**Additional Notes**

  * Increasing physical memory or swap file space //will have no effect// on this problem.  The limitation is inherent to 32-bit systems.  64-bit systems do not have this problem.
  * nXt is more memory-intensive than previous versions.  Some models which rendered using legacy versions may not render using nXt.
