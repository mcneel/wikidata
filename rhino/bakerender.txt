====== BakeRender plugin page ======

> **Summary:** //a free plugin to bake textures with BakeAIR directly from Rhino 4//


=====What is BakeRender ?=====

BakeRender is a UserInterface for Rhino3D version 4.0 to automatically create baking ready *.rib (RenderMan Interface Bytestream) files with the help of RhinoAIR and the AIR Rendering engine from Sitexgraphics. Generated rib files are passed to BakeAIR the texture and lightning baker for baking.

Resulting (baked) textures are assigned to their geometry in Rhino and can be viewed in realtime using the "BakeRender" display mode which is provided with this plugin. Scenes baked with BakeRender can be used for realtime presentations, (faster) re-rendering with AIR and other renderers which support textures assigned through Rhino`s standart material assignment dialogs.

<color green> Any scene (with materials) which can be rendered with AIR from within Rhino 4 and the "RhinoAir" Plugin can be used for baking with this toolset. </color>

=====Installation=====

1. Extract the contents of the "BakeRenderV2.zip" file anywhere. Make shure to **preserve the folder structure**.

2. Open Rhino, drag the extracted "BakeRender.rhp" plugin file over the Rhino window to register it.

3. Load the extracted "BakeRenderV2.tb" workspace by choosing:

''Tools / ToolbarLayout / Files / Open
''

4. Load the extracted "BakeRender.ini" display mode in Rhino by choosing:

''Rhino Options / Appearance / Advanced Settings / Import
''

5. Add a new file search path in Rhino which points to your extracted "BakeRender V2" folder by choosing:

''Rhino Options / Files / Search path/ File search paths''

The BakeRender tools have now been installed and are ready to use. A help document named "help.htm" is included with the downloadable archive. You can also open the helpfile by right clicking on the BakeRender button in the toolbar or access it from the opened user interface by clicking on the help button.

=====Screenshots=====

> **Info:** //Scenes shown below are baked with BakeAir by Sitexgraphics. The Air renderer was used to setup and preview materials and lightning. Note that you need Rhino 4 to preview these examples as Rhino 5 uses a new mesher which does rebuild the render meshes and therefore destroys the texture mapping information//

\\
Parts of the first BakeRender scene, created in 2005. It used 510 textures (one per surface) which has been reduced to 66 maps (one per object) by using Rhino`s "packed" texture coordinates for Polysurfaces. A default gamma of 1.0 was used for baking to export the final scene into a famous game editor. Most of the materials are free darktree shaders. Click on the image for a larger version.
