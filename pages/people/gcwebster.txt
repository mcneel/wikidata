> **Info:** //Olá. Welcome to my humble wiki page. I'm not a VB Expert, but I do my best. If you'd like to report a bug (or maybe a spelling / grammar mistake), to send a suggestion or just contact me, feel free to send an [[gcwebster36@gmail.com|e-mail.]]//

This [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/gcwebster-rhinoscripts.zip|.zip file]] (last revision: **03 / Fev / 06**) contains all the scripts described below, saved in **.rvb** format - it is simpler than upload every single script...

These .rvb files are ready to be copied and pasted to a button. Take a look at the [[developer:macroscriptsetup|MacroScriptSetup]] tutorial page to know what I'm talkin 'bout.

==AbsTol==
Quickly change the absolute tolerance of a document.

==AnglePivot==
Runs the Angle command with a pivot point.

==AnnotateCrvLengths==

==AnnotateCrvRadius==

==BothColors==
Quicly changes both wireframe and render/material colors of any objects.

==ClearAllMeshes==
Runs the ClearAllMeshes command with a secure confirmation box.

==ClearUndo==
Runs the ClearUndo command with a secure confirmation box.

==ClosedPlanarCrvIndAreaCentroids==
Creates individual area centroids for each closed planar curve selected.

==CopyToPt==
Copies several objects to selected points at the same time.

(Original idea by [[people:davidrutten|Gelfling aka David Rutten]] )

==CSec2==
Automatically creates open curves from the intersection between given cross-section and profile curves.

==DigDisconnect==
Runs the DigDisconnect command with a secure confirmation box.

==EncloseCrvs==
Encloses open planar curves inside a closed planar curve boundary.

==ExtendCrvs==
One of the most useful scripts I've ever written: extend several curves at the same time.

==IndAreaCentroids==
Creates individual area centroids for each srf or polysrf selected.

==IndBoundingBoxes==
Creates individual bounding boxes for each object selected.

==IndProjBB==
Creates projected to Cplane bounding boxes for each object selected.

==InvBottom==
Sets an "Invert Bottom" view in any Rhino document.

==InvTop==
Sets an "Invert Top" view in any Rhino document.

==InvDel==
Simply inverts selection and delete remaining objects - with a secure confirmation box.

==OffsetCrvs==
Offsets more than one curve at the same time, including a  "BothSides"  option.

==OriBB==
Creates an oriented Bounding Box accordingly to a 3pt Cplane. (thanks for the help, Pascal!)

==Orient2pt_pivot==
The orient command with a pivot point (same first point on both reference and target).

==ProjBB==
Also extremely useful: creates a Projected To Cplane Bounding Box.

==QuadMirror==
Mirror an object twice, first horizontally and then vertically, using the origin, resulting in 4 equal objects.

(hmmm...is this clear enough?)

==RenderColor==
Quicly changes the render/material color of objects.

==ResetBothColors==
Re-assigns both wireframe and render/material color of objects as "By Layer".

==ResetColor==
Re-assigns the wireframe color of objects as "By Layer".

==ResetRenderColor==
Re-assigns render/material color of objects as "By Layer".

==SelCrvInPlane==
Selects only the planar curves in a model that coincides with the active CPlane.

==SelPlanar==

==SelPlanarPolysrf==

==SelPlanarSrf==

==ShowE==
All objects of the model on the screen - basically unlocks and shows everything.

==Txt2Crv==
Transforms text objects in curves.

==UndoViewChangeInAllViewports==

==WireColor==
Quicly changes the wireframe color of objects.

===== Workspace=====

[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/gcwebsterRH3_SR4.zip|Here]] it's possible to download my personal workspace file, with custom buttons and organization. It contains the macros below, all scripts above and other useful codes from some VB masters such as [[http://www.avgauge.com|Dan Bayn]] , [[http://www.reconstructivism.net|Gelfling / David Rutten]] , [[http://www.morellosnc.it/m2/cad/rhino/|Emilio Morello]] and [[http://www.rayflectar-graphics.com/Rhino/RhinoScripts-Gallery.htm|Thomas Anagnostou.]]

===== Macros=====

[[rhino:basicmacros|Macros]] are usually quite easy and simple. Here are some of mine:

==New file using template==
Just replace YOURTEMPLATE with the real name of the template wanted.

{@

======-_New YOURTEMPLATE======

}@

==SelColor+Hide & SelColor+InvHide==

{@

======_SelColor======
_pause
_Hide

}@

{@

======_SelColor======
_pause
_Invert
_Hide

}@

==Set the Default layer on==
You obviously must have a layer named "default".

{@

======-_OneLayerOn Default======

}@

==Open the Units Tab in Document Properties page==

{@

'_NoEcho
'//DocumentPropertiesPage //Units

}@

==Set the Gradient View ON in all viewports & Set the Gradient View OFF in all viewports==

{@

======_NoEcho======
-GradientView
View

Enter

}@

{@

======_NoEcho======
-GradientView
View

State

Enter

}@

==Show Wireframes on render & Don't show wireframes on render==
It works only with TreeFrog as the current renderer .

{@

======_NoEcho======
-_DocumentProperties
_TreeFrog
_Wireframe=yes
//Enter //Enter

_SetRedrawOn
_Echo

}@

{@

======_NoEcho======
-_DocumentProperties
_TreeFrog
_Wireframe=no
//Enter //Enter

_SetRedrawOn
_Echo

}@

==Blend curve: tangent - position continuity==
Creates a blend curve using G1 and G0 continuities in the first and last input, respectively.

You can use this macro as a model to create other continuity combinations.

{@

======_Blend======
continuity=tangency

_pause
continuity=position

}@

==Line: Perpendicular from Curve, Both Sides from First Point==

{@

====== Line Perpendicular======
_BothSides
_pause
_FromFirstPoint

}@

==Mark Both Curve Start and End==

{@

====== _NoEcho======
_CrvStart
_CrvEnd

}@
