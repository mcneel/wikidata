=====Overview=====
I have several licenses that I want to add to the Zoo. So, I have created a text file and added these licenses, per the instruction in the Zoo help file. I then try to import these licenses using the Zoo Administrator's File â†’ Import command. But, when I do, I received the following error for every license:

=====Answer=====
Rhino 5 licenses cannot be imported into Zoo. This is because each Rhino 5 license must be validated. And, if you are upgrading from a Rhino 4 license, this license will also need to be provided.

The solution is to added each Rhino 5 licenses one-by-one:
You can only add Rhino 5 keys one at a time to Zoo 5.

Specifically this issue is relates to the validation.
Currently the validation system can only process one license at a time.
Rhino 4 did not require validation for Zoo licenses, so Rhino 4 did not have the problem.
A bulk validation is on the wish list.
