[[https://vimeo.com/help/compression|Video Technical Requirements:]]  
  * Resolution: 720p HD Video 16:9 aspect ratio, 1280 x 720 px
  * Bit rates: 720p	5,000 – 10,000
  * Frame rates: Vimeo recommends uploading with frame rates of 24 (or 23.976), 25, and 30 (or 29.97).
  * Codec: Codec: H.264

[[https://vimeo.com/help/compression|General Considerations:]]
  * The video review process will take about 30 days.
  * Be prepared to redo your video at least twice, We will give you recommendations and will ask that you makes the changes/additions that we request and resubmit. We could go back and forth with you 2-3 times until the video is tuned up. This will hopefully be an informative process for you.
  * Before you start, close any toolbars from plug-ins that you will not be using. Set the interface as close to the default as possible. 
  * Be concise.
  * Make sure your presentation stays focused on the lesson you have designed. Mention, if needed, but avoid getting side-tracked by, the details of the user interface if they are not specific to the task at hand. It's usually OK to assume some basic knowledge of how Rhino works on the part of the viewer.
  * Before you publish or submit a training video watch your video carefully, //as a new user// - ask yourself if the material is conveyed clearly and completely and with a minimum of fuss.
  * And, be concise.
===== ART candidates: =====
Please DropBox the video or tutorial to [[pascal@mcneel.com|Pascal Golay.]] 
We will review it and send back any corrections.
Please make corrections and resubmit. Repeat until the video is tuned up and officially accepted as your ART project.


===== Additional Information =====

**The ART requirement of McNeel Level 1 & 2 training is designed to //teach you to teach Rhino//, not learn it.** 
You should already know Rhino very well and be looking to support and teach Rhino.

**On-Demand will help you prepare for the class, but it will not fulfill the Level 1 or Level 2 requirement.**
Level 1 and Level 2 can be taken on a no charge space available basis in the Seattle, Miami, or regional McNeel offices.

**In the North American region, Level 1 Online does count for your ART.** You will assist the instructor and help with chat questions for the Online to count as your ART requirement. However, there are no discounts for this class. The online class is not free, but it is discounted for all, $200 instead of $695. You may take the class in Seattle on a no charge space available basis, but you do need to pay for your own travel expenses and arrange accommodations.

**During the online class you will serve as TA.** You need to be present for all the sessions, monitor the Chat windows, alert instructor of issues. Sometimes the instructor will ask you for a review of questions. You will be trained in the orientation session. It works well, the instructors are very experienced getting the TA comfortable, and most TA's really enjoy this.

**With the Online Level 1 option, you will still need to travel to Seattle for the Level 2.** We schedule our Level 2 classes every 2-3 months. Please email [[jody@mcneel.com|Jody Mills]] or call (206)634-4571 if you would like to register.

**//Will the chat questions interrupt my own participation?//**
If you are learning, yes. 
Some take the class, and then return to TA in the next session. 
The repeat for the TA is no charge. 
The classes are recorded and you may stream for 3 months to review the lessons.

**Evaluation During Rhino Level 2** In this final Level 2 in our classroom, you are evaluated for Rhino skills and knowledge. Some ARTs do not pass and have to take the class a second time. Another option is to prepare by doing the Level 2 online before coming to Seattle.   

**McNeel Regions**
Your McNeel Regional Office may have special requirements for your ART. Please contact your region and inquiry about any special requirements or restrictions. Find the contact in your McNeel Regional Office [[here.]]

**Submit Video and Apply!**
It generally take 6-12 month for users to get all the ART requirements done.
Please email [[mary@mcneel.com|Mary Fugier]] with any additional questions.
//Thanks for considering becoming an ART.//
