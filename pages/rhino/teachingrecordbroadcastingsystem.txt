====== Teaching Record Broadcasting System ======

Teaching Record Broadcasting System (TRBS) is a software solution that broadcasts the teacher's screen to all students' monitors. We believe that TDHelp32.exe, the app that runs in the background on the student and teacher's computers, is either replacing the system's OpenGL32 dll with its own version or hooking into the [[rhino:opengl|OpenGL]] pipeline to  allow the instructor to broadcast to the student's computer.  There is a bug in their software that is conflicting with Rhino's OpenGL use, and causing Rhino to crash.  The work-around is to terminate TDHelp32.exe in Windows Task Manager before running Rhino.  Apparently this does not affect the broadcasting system and the teacher is still able to send his screen to the students' monitors.
