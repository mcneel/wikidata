=====Display Troubleshooting: Microsoft GDI Generic=====


Having GDI Generic listed in Rhino's OpenGL options page indicates that your graphics card was not found or is not being used by Rhino. 

**To fix this, turn on Rhino Hardware Acceleration**

  - On the Rhino **Tools** menu, click **Options** > **View** > **OpenGL**.
  - Check the **Use accelerated hardware modes** box.

The OpenGL Options page should now list a different video manufacturer and adapter type. To configure this new set-up, please follow the [[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:failure|Video Adapter Identification Page]]

If the Video manufacturer continues to display **Microsoft GDI Generic** and the computer is a Mac running Bootcamp, the OS X Bootcamp Drivers may be out of date.\\
\\
To update your Bootcamp drivers:
  - **Restart** your computer.
  - Hold the **Option** key while your computer starts.
  - Select the **Mac** partition, and **boot to Mac OS X**.
  - From the **Apple** menu, click **Updates**.
  - **Install** all OS X updates.
  - Restart back into the Bootcamp Windows partition
  - The OpenGL Options page should now list a different video manufacturer and adapter type. To configure this new set-up, please follow the [[rhino:5:video:troubleshooting:failure|Video Adapter Identification Page]]
