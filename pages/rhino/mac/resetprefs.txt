Here are a few procedures for manipulating your collection of settings/preferences for Rhino for Mac.


====== Rhino 8 for Mac ======

In Rhino 8 for Mac, you can reset your Settings/Preferences using the **Reset** command.

Some or all of Rhino's Settings can be restored to their default values.

The //Save Settings for Support...// button allows you to zip up all of your settings for archival purposes (useful for sending to McNeel developers for diagnosis).

Rhino 8 for Mac stores its Settings in the following folder:

///Users/[yourname]/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/[version]/settings//

Each time you use **Reset** to reset your settings, Rhino saves a backup copy to the:

///Users/[yourname]/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/[version-backup-date]//

folder so they can always be retrieved if your Reset in error.
====== Older Versions of Rhino ======

Rhino for Mac versions 5-7 provide three commands for managing your preferences:

  - **ExportPreferences**: Allows you to export your preferences .plist file for backup or sharing.
  - **ImportPreferences**: Allows you to selectively import preferences from a .plist file.
  - **ResetPreferences**: Deletes the changed preferences values at the time you run it.  When you close Rhino, the application saves your preferences at that point, including window positions, sidebar preferences, and anything else you have used/changed since you ran ResetPreferences.

The above commands are highly recommended for management of preferences.  However, if you are having trouble with your preferences, the following manual steps can be employed...

==== Save a copy of your current Rhino for Mac Preferences - OLD  ====
  - **Quit** Rhino completely.
  - In the **Finder**, hold down the **Option** key, and select **Library** in the **Go** menu.
  - Open the **Preferences** folder.
  - Find the **com.mcneel.rhinoceros.plist** file.  Select **Duplicate** in the right-click context menu to make a copy.  The copy will be named **com.mcneel.rhinoceros copy.plist**.  (**NOTE**: In Rhino 7 or later, the preferences file includes a version number, such as: com.mcneel.rhinoceros.7.plist)

==== Reset Rhino Preferences - OLD ====
Follow this procedure to remove all of your changed Rhino preferences and reset all of them to the original values.

  - **Quit** Rhino.
  - Start the **Terminal** application found in your **Applications** > **Utilities** folder. \\ A window with a command prompt appears.
  - Type **defaults delete com.mcneel.rhinoceros** and press Return. 
**NOTE**: In Rhino 7 or later, the preferences file includes a version number, such as: 

**defaults delete com.mcneel.rhinoceros.7.plist**

**defaults delete com.mcneel.rhinoceros.8.plist**

  - Wait until the Terminal prompt comes back. This can take 15-20 seconds.
  - Quit the Terminal application.

==== Restore saved Rhino Preferences - OLD  ====
Follow this procedure to replace all of your current Rhino preferences with a previously saved copy.

  - **Quit** Rhino.
  - In the Finder, hold down the **Option** key, and select **Library** in the Go menu.
  - Open the **Preferences** folder.
  - Find the **com.mcneel.rhinoceros.plist** file.  Drag it to the Trash.  (**NOTE**: In Rhino 7 or later, the preferences file includes a version number, such as: com.mcneel.rhinoceros.7.plist)
  - Rename your previously saved preferences file to **com.mcneel.rhinoceros.plist**.
    - Note: If you moved your saved plist file to a different folder, you need to drag it back into the **preferences** folder.
  - Start the Terminal application found in your Applications > Utilities folder. \\ A window with a command prompt appears.
