====== McNeel Training Overview ======

McNeel offers private, online training for individuals and groups. Training content and topics covered can be customized and tailored to your group's needs.
With the exception of customized training, McNeel training content is based on our Level 1 and Level 2 training guides. The training guides are not tutorials but class notes to accompany the instructor-led training. 
If you do not already have the software, you can prepare for the class by downloading the evaluation software. Review the outline and guide for your class. By doing this, you will be well on your way to learning Rhino before taking your training.

===== Online training =====
McNeel offers private, online training for individuals and groups. Online sessions are recorded and uploaded for you to review and build skills after the training has ended. Videos of each session are posted to a private album so you may review material at your leisure. //**Videos can be streamed for up to 3 months.**//

With online training, you may learn Rhino on your own schedule and at your own pace, from the convenience of your desktop or mobile device.

==== Any time - any where ====
=== Option 1 - Video rental ====
You can rent the videos from a previous online training series. Rentals are offered for a 90-day period to coincide with the 90-day Rhino Eval period. For more information on video retail, see [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/ondemand|Rhino OnDemand Training.]]
\\
=== Option 2 - Get videos and take the live class ====
Because the online classes are recorded you may start a training session at any time. Just sign up for the next session, and email [[mary@mcneel.com|Mary Fugier.]] The typical cancellation policy is 48 hours or 2 days before the orientation session. If you waive the option to cancel, you can get streaming access to the videos of the previous training session immediately for no additional charge. So you may prepare for the live training with the videos from the previous session. This will help you know the questions to ask the instructor during your training.
 
Online training is also an outstanding option because you can:
  - Prepare for the live training with the videos of the previous session.
  - Attend the live training.
  - Stream the live training sessions. 
//All three options for the cost of one online training class!//

**Time restrictions**

In addition, you are not required to be available for every online training session. You may need to arrive late, or leave early. The online training format can accommodate your limitations. 

Since the sessions are recorded, online training is also good option for existing Rhino users who wish to explore a Rhino or a plug-in they have not used in the past.

password: **Test** (with a capital T)

**Having some idea on how Rhino works but having not taken Level 1, would Level 2 be appropriate? I would like to reach a good level to manage the tool properly or at least know that I can use it well enough.** 
 //Level 2 assumes Level 1 proficiency. Download and review the Level 1 and Level 2 materials above, and see which one best fits your current skill level.//

**IÂ´m looking for an online course in the next few months.  Is there a possibility to start the course a little bit sooner?** 
 //If you register for an online class, and waive the option to drop, we can release the videos and class materials from the previous class for your study and preparation. You will get the videos from the previous class, the live class and the videos from the live class. The videos are posted to a private video album for you to stream for up to 3 months.//

**My connection to Internet is not good at the moment, but I would like to know if I could watch the online sessions later on if I were to have troubles.**  
// Yes, all sessions are recorded and posted for streaming from a private Vimeo album.//

**Would you provide the link to download the version that is going to be used in the Rhino class?**
// We use Rhino 5 for Windows unless otherwise noted in all our training, both classroom and online. You may use the [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download|Rhino 5 for Windows Evaluation - 90 day]] in the class.//

**Can I use the Rhino for Mac OSX beta for the Rhino Windows training?**
// The Rhino for OSX is not acceptable for a Windows Rhino class. Also Windows emulators, like VMware and Parallels are not a supported Rhino platform and are generally not adequate for training. We do have Level 1 and Level 2 training with are specifically for Rhino for Mac.//
