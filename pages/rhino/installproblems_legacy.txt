======Troubleshooting Installer Issues for Rhino 3 and Rhino 4 ======

=====Rhino 4 starts up with no plug-ins loaded=====
**Problem:**

Missing toolbars and no plug-ins loaded on Vista.

A small number of people have reported that installing Rhino V4 (SR2 and newer) on Vista results in no plug-ins and no toolbars loaded unless they are logged in and running as the Administrator.  This has been more common on Vista Home Premium systems, but has been reported on all flavors of Vista.  Most people do not report this problem and we have not been able to duplicate the problem here in the Rhino Development Team.

**Solution:**

Users report that if they turn off User Account Control (Control Panel - User Accounts), and temporarily disable any antivirus and system protection software before running the Rhino installation again, they solve the problem.  After reinstalling and running Rhino once, you should restart your antivirus and system protection tools.  Also, you can turn UAC back on if you want.

=====Rhino 3 Problem with toolbar layouts not sticking and docking correctly=====

  - Close Rhino 3.0.
  - Run this utility: http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/Rhino3_Registry_Repair.zip while Rhino is closed.

=====Rhino 4 Installer Determining Disk Space Requirements never completes=====
**Problem:**

When installing Rhino 4.0, a message appears that says "please wait while the installer finishes determining your disk space requirements". This dialog box never disappears.

**Cause:**

The Windows Installer engine tries to determine if there is enough disk space on all your drives to install Rhino. For some reason, this process takes a very long time, or never completes. The real cause is buried somewhere in Microsoft's Windows Installer engine.

**Solution:** ////

Run the installer from the command prompt:
  -Please download [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/4.0/release|Rhino 4.0 Service Release 9]]. Releases older than SR1 do not deploy properly using Active Directory or SMS.
  -Extract the downloaded file into folders by [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/rhino4/manual_extract_from_file|uncompressing the EXE into folders.]]
  - Run this on the command line: msiexec /i Rhino4_Setup.msi /qr

=====Rhino 3 Help's Index tab is blank=====

**Problem:**

The Index tab of the Rhino Help or BonusToolsHelp window is blank for low-privilege user logins in Windows 2000.

**Solution:**

This is a permissions problem that interacts with a bug in Windows 2000. Here's how to fix it without changing the permissions on Program Files folders.
  * Have an administrator delete the file Rhino.GID in the ...Program Files\Rhino\English\Help folder. While you are at it, delete the RhinoBonusTools.GID.
  * Then have the administrator log out. (Don't run the Help yet, or it will recreate the GID file for the administrator.)
  * Have the low-privilege user log in. The Index tab should now populate (and a GID file is created somewhere in the user's personal files area.)
  * This trick is not needed on Windows XP. Microsoft fixed the bug.
  * Another way it can be fixed on Windows 2000 is to add the permission "Write" for Users on the ...Rhino\English\Help folder.
