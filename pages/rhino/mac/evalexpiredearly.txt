====== Why did my 90-day Rhino evaluation stop saving after only 30 days? (Rhino 5 for Mac) ======

=====Problem=====
Rhino for Mac reports it can not Save or Export after only 30 days.

=====Answer=====
Rhino licenses must be Validated and Rhino restarted within the 30-day Validation grace period. If Validation and restarting is postponed more than 30 days, Rhino will temporarily lose the ability to Save or Export.

  - Run the ValidateLicense command
  - Complete the steps
  - If you are running Mac Rhino 5.2.2 or older, you must Quit Rhino (Cmd+Q) and restart Rhino before saving is restored. [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5/evaluation|Mac Rhino 5.2.3]] and newer will allow you to save immediately after completing license validation.

==File Save and Export functionality will be restored for the duration of the 90-day evaluation==
