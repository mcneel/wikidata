====== How to provide parameters for automated deployment of Flamingo 2.0 ======

====== How to Edit the Flamingo 2.0 Setup .INI file for automated installs======
At the bottom of this page is displayed the literal content of template INI file that can be used when installing Flamingo 2.0 from ActiveDirectory or SMS, or via a batch script, see **[[flamingo:flamingo2:installini|Flamingo 2.0 Automated Installation]]**  for detailed instructions.

You should get a fresh copy of the template INI file from **[[http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/Flamingo2Setup.zip|Flamingo2Setup.ini]]** or from the Flamingo folder of your Flamingo 2.0 CD.

Edit this .INI file with a text editor like NotePad.

The capitalized parts are the special keywords (MSI Properties) that the Flamingo installer recognizes.  To have one of them be fed to the installer MSI, remove the pound sign # at the beginning of the line, and set the content on the right of the equal sign appropriately.  If you were to use the file as it is at the bottom of this page, the only parameters that would affect the install would be "INSTALL_EN=1" and "RMA_CDKEY="

=====Parameters=====
FOLDER="C:\Program Files\Flamingo 2.0"   -  Specify the folder to install into, can be any location.  Must be surrounded by quotes if the path contains spaces.  If you don't specify this, Flamingo will install in ...Program Files\Flamingo 2.0

RMA_CDKEY=AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEE - provides the CD-Key for the installation. Use this to install as a standalone node. The CD-Key can also be entered with no dashes, and may include RH40- at the beginning or not.

INSTALL_EN=1   -  Install English language support -- Supports running Flamingo in English, and includes English Help, Tutorials, Sample Files, etc.  The other langauges are controlled by INSTALL_FR, INSTALL_DE, INSTALL_IT, INSTALL_JA and INSTALL_ES and you can give the value 1 to any or all of them.

=====Optional Parameters:=====
WORKGROUP_NODE=1  -  Alternative to the RMA_CDKEY entry, when you want the station to get its Flamingo CDKey from the Zoo license manager (www.rhino3d.com/zoo.htm) each time it starts.
