**Manually remove Rhino and Reinstall**

**The Problem**: Installing Rhino 5.0 for Mac over an existing installation of Rhino 4.0 for Mac may not work properly. In this case, you will see this error message:

**The Solution**: Rhino needs to be manually removed from your computer and reinstalled:
Remove Rhino by dragging the Rhino 4.0 or Rhino 5.0 application to the trash.
Install Rhino 5.0 for Mac using the installer you downloaded. You do not need to download another copy.

**Technical Details**:

If you are technically curious about what went wrong, see [[http://mac.rhino3d.com/forums/t/2066.aspx|this post]] in the Mac Rhino support forum.
