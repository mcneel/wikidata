======FireFly Workshop Prep======

Everyone will need to install a few applications (if they don't already have them on their machine).  

The software programs we'll be using are as follows:
  * Arduino IDE 1.0.5 (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#toc2).  The installer should automatically install the necessary drivers on each machine, so it would be good to have this installed prior to the workshop.
  * Firefly 1.0.0.68 (http://fireflyexperiments.com/download/).  Just fill out the form and then download the appropriate installer given your version of Rhino (ie. 32-bit vs. 64-bit).  It's helpful to already have the arduino software installed prior to installing this application.
  * Weaverbird (http://www.giuliopiacentino.com/weaverbird/).  We may be using a few of these components for one or two tutorials, so it can be helpful to have the latest version of this installed.
  * 
The only other thing they may need to have is a webcam.  There's a small glitch in the current Firefly build which requires you to have a webcam installed in order for it to run properly.  I've been trying to track down why this is... but it's a weird little glitch.  It doesn't have to be a fancy webcam... it can be a simple USB webcam if you don't have an internal webcam on your machine... but it is important as I'll also be walking through some material on computer vision (similar to the Guadalajara workshop)... so having an image capturing device handy will be important.
