** AccuRender Network Rendering with The [[accurender:ar4:networkrendering|farm]] **

> **Summary:** //Using several networked AccuRender computers to render a large or complicated image can dramatically reduce rendering times.//
======Overview======
The [[accurender:ar4:networkrendering|farm]] is a small program that runs on one computer on your network. Its job is to collect AccuRender rendering jobs submitted by users on the network and distribute the rendering job to the available rendering systems (**Slaves**) on the network.

All of the information required to process a rendering is stored in a folder on a network shared drive. Finished renders are output to another shared folder and can be e-mailed to a specified address if required.

The [[accurender:ar4:networkrendering|farm]] software is included on the AccuRender 4.0 CD, or download the latest version from http://download.mcneel.com/accurender/4.0/farm.asp


======System Requirements======
  * The **Farm** software usually runs on the network server, but it can be running on any computer on the network.
  * The **Slaves** are full AutoCAD/AccuRender workstations with all of the software and hardware needed to run [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] and AccuRender.
  * **Note**: The [[accurender:ar4:networkrendering|farm]] and Slave components can both be running on the same machine if required.
