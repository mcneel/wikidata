====== Windows Security Settings & License Validation ======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:home|Zoo]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses Windows security settings and how it effects license validation.//

===== Symptoms: ====
  * The Zoo cannot connect to the McNeel Validation Server at https://api.mcneel.com.
  * Internet Explorer cannot connect to https://api.mcneel.com from the validation server, though other browsers will succeed.

===== Solution: =====
Enable PKCS Key Exchange Algorithm by setting the **Enabled** value of the following registry key to **0xffffffff**.

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\KeyExchangeAlgorithms\PKCS
Name:  Enabled
Type:  REG_DWORD
Value: 0xffffffff
</code>

===== Discussion: =====
A recommended Windows Security setting interferes with validating licenses in the LAN Zoo on Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016 and 2019.

If PKCS is disabled, the LAN Zoo cannot connect to the McNeel Validation Server.

Setting the **Enabled** value to **0xffffffff** (or deleting it) is enough to get things working again. The default value for Enabled is 0x0.
