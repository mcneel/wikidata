|[[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/|{{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/images/GH_SquareBanner.jpg}}]]|Grasshopper® is a graphical algorithm editor tightly integrated with Rhino’s 3-D modeling tools. Unlike RhinoScript, rhino.Python, or other programming languages, Grasshopper requires no knowledge of programming or scripting, but still allows designers to develop form generation algorithms without writing code. |

Error loading Grasshopper?
[[http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=26347
|Visual Studio C++ Redistributables 6-7-11 version.]]
 
Rhino 4 runs in 32bit (even on a 64 bit OS) and requires file **//vcredist_x86.EXE 2.0 MB//**.

This is a common issue with Microsoft Runtimes that are out of sync in windows.

Note that you need the most recent Microsoft Runtimes to be able to load Grasshopper in Rhino4. You can download the latest runtimes from the Microsoft Website, and be sure to get the 32-bit ones (vcredist_x86.EXE).
