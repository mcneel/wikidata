====== Do I need to uninstall Rhino before installing a newer version? (Rhino for Mac) ======
> **Summary:** //Do I need to uninstall Rhino for Mac before installing a newer version?//

No, you do not.  You can overwrite the application bundle - most frequently located in the Applications folder - when you install a newer version.  This will not overwrite your license or any of your preferences. Both are stored in other folders.  

In fact, you can run two versions of Rhino side-by-side, if you desire. Just rename the application bundle (Rhinoceros.app) to something different (RhinocerosCopy.app - for example).
