The mission of the Instituto de Biomecánica de Valencia (IBV) as a technological centre is to promote and undertake scientific research, technological development, technical advice and training in the area of Biomechanics.

Rhino is one of the key products used for research and commercial work at IBV. A result of the acquired experience in shoe design and manufacturing resulted in the advanced tutorial CD [[http://www.rhino3d.com/advanced.htm#footwear|Shoe Design and Visualization]] .

[[http://www.eu.rhino3d.com/IBV_2006.pdf|Click here]] (1,4 Mb) and see a recent example of a commercial sole and shoe created by the IBV for the [[http://www.the-art-company.com|ART company]] , where Rhino and Microscribe were used to digitize an existing last; then the final last, sole and upper part were modelled in Rhino and Sensable and finally prototyped with a ZCorp color 3D printer.

I am an artist from and currently working in Michigan. I've been using 2D software as a graphic designer and as a layout tool in my 3D work since 1995. I've been using Rhino casually since getting a copy of the demo in 2000, but finally got serious about it in 2003 when the school where I teach jewelry design (Kendall College of Art and Design purchased the first of our 4 CNC milling machines, and eventually an Envisitiontec Perfactory RP system.

My work can be seen at [[http://www.optilevers.com|www.optilevers.com]]

A few of the schools that have CAD/CAM systems within their art departments, especially the crafts, are starting a new resource sharing consortium that is WIKI enabled. Though you must be a registered user to edit it - [[http://www.cadlaboration.com|www.cadlaboration.com]]

I've only been a member of the Rhino community for 18 months now, but I've been working with 3D modeling since 1997. Before retraining in London as a jewelry designer and blacksmith, I worked for a military contractor desigining models and environments for flight simulators.

Bringing the traditional hand skills of metal work into 3D modeling was an exciting challenge. Rhino 3, with its history in the product design field, seemed the natural choice, and proved itself to be a highly useful and flexible platform for the task.

Now, for [[http://www.modjewelry.com|MOD Jewelry]] , I have helped implement a process that combines hand-made manufacturing with Illustrator, Rhino, ArtCAM and the Solidscape RP machine to generate miniaturized logos for all varieties of custom jewelry with unprecedented speed and quality.

What used to take weeks to create by hand can now be modeled, prototyped, cast, and in production in little over a week. And when one considers the aggressive license policies of many of our clientele (Harley-Davidson, FFA, 12 Step Program), this precision gives us more freedom than ever before while still giving them what they want.

My latest work appears seasonally on the [[http://www.modjewelry.com|MOD Jewelry website]] . In addition, my own portfolio can be found at [[http://www.neujack.com|www.neujack.com]] .

Desperately looking for an effective & affordable tool for design and development, i started with autocad and moved to Rhinoceros in its early days, self learning was easy with Rhino. Between Autocad and Rhinoceros, I experimented with other high end CAD packages, but soon left all the packages in favour of Rhinoceros. Have been using it extensively since then, for industrial design. Since 2001 I have been working in Netherlands, utilising Rhinoceros as a tool for industrial design and development.

Preserving design intent (economically) was made possible for me, by Rhinoceros. Whatever i design, i can deliver. I love Rhinoceros. Some examples/samples of my work can be sighted at http://www.coroflot.com/rajathomas

I was about to give up on CG altogether when I discovered Rhino 1.0 during my first year at uni. I've used it extensively for architectural and urban project and eventually discovered my true calling through RhinoScript. Since then I've written a handout about RhinoScript, gave a lecture in London, hosted a workshop in Vienna and written hundreds of scripts for the public domain. Part of my site is dedicated to Rhino, scripting and programming;

I'm located in Seattle working at Delta Marine( [[http://www.deltamarine.com|www.deltamarine.com]] ). I've been using Rhino since v1.0 and have really become addicted. I also teach Rhino at Seattle Central Community College actively converting people to Rhino from their other 3d software (which is very easy). I have studied design, drafting and art.

I'm a [[http://www.imdb.com/Glossary/S#set_designer|set designer]] for [[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1113080/|feature films]] working in the Los Angeles area. We use Rhino heavily for quickly generating models to fly the director and production designer through. Where Rhino becomes indispensable (like it isn't already) is when, as often is the case, we are doing something very free form and organic, Rhino not only allows us to model such complex forms, but also to section our models every which way to generate useful information for our construction departments.

----
I am a metal sculptor in the Los Angeles area and had been using 2D CAD products for years, but still had to build elaborate physical models to present my ideas to clients.  I tried demos of just about every available 3D CAD product out there and decided that I would need to work in CAD full-time to become proficient enough to justify the use of the software.  Then someone showed me rhino, and I was hooked the first day... here was a package I could really use for my work, without having to be a full-time CAD guy.  It's revolutionized the way I create sculpture, and has kept me highly competitive in tough field. Almost all my work these days is designed and presented using rhino, and you can see this work at [[http://www.publicsculpture.com|PublicSculpture.com]]

Rhino entered my life as an early pre release version in 1996 after I read an article about "Nurbs for Windows" in what became 3D world. From that point on I was addicted and has used Rhino as my nr.1 modelling programe since. I use Rhino somewhere in all my design work, both for graphics and 3D production or vizualisation. I have been teaching rhino in Norway for many years and have been a sertified teacher for over two years. [[http://www.holografisk.no|www.holografisk.no]] (so far only in Norwegian)

Probably most noted for my work with Flamingo much of which has probably been down to luck rather than judgment.  Still, its seen me through 3 years of business for very little financial outlay and I can get it to do pretty much what I want.  Hoping to try and get as much as i can down in writing in the flamingo section of the Wiki.  Generally very excited by the development of V4 and Brazil R/S as a rendering plug-in - exciting times for rhinophiles everywhere I think!!

**[[phill@masterwerkes.com| Phill Pittman ]]    -  Carving with Rhino**

----
My lifelong business of architectural carving and heroic scale sculpture took a whole new turn when I discovered Rhino. Soon after, I turned my very traditional carving studio into full time cnc carving, CAD development and production.  From concept to rendering, I primarily design (and present) from within Rhino.  I also keep quite busy in a product development and prototype arm of my business. Full scale auto body panels, small craft, statues and surfboards keep life interesting. Contract architectural ornament design fufills my creative needs when I am not working on my full scale 3-d "Last Supper". Hopefully I will get it finished (with the help of Rhino) before I kick off. I would have never gotten past first base without the newsgroup, a sincere thanks to all!  [[http://www.masterwerkes.com|www.masterwerkes.com]]


**[[jack@jhkunnen.name|Jack Kunnen]] A Rhino-mold-design-phile...**

----
I started using Rhino with version 1 Beta just to read in IGES files that Cadkey and Microstation won't.  Now I'm doing all the 3d work for my mold and die cast die designs.  I've found Rhino to be faster and more accurate than any of the Cad systems I've been trained on.  I do like the feature trees of solid modelers, but these modelers still can't handle the surfaces on the parts I get to work with, only Nurbs will to the trick.  Can't wait for the release version 4.

Born 1983 and located in the south of Brazil, I'm an addicted Rhino user always looking for improvements. I started to work with it when the software was on the version 2.0.

For almost 3 years I'd worked developing 3D projects for brands such as adidas, Diadora, Clarks and others. At December 2004 I decided to learn VB / Rhinoscript (using [[DavidRutten|David's]] [[http://www2.rhino3d.com/resources/display.asp?language=en&listing=601|handout]] ) to develop my own scripts. Since March / 2006 I'm dedicating myself mostly to my Industrial Design graduation studies, but Rhino still plays an important part in my life. Nowadays I can humbly consider myself an advanced user - but I'll never quit learning some more...

I am a designer in the field of tensile structures. I just can't do my job without Rhino. From the first pilot study to really tricky workshop drawing problems, Rhino rules. I use it in conjunction with SolidWorks, and they both communicate quite well. The [[DavidRutten|Gelfling]] did a pretty amazing job in making my (work) life even better with a few of his magic scripts, but using his great scripting handout, I'm starting to do my own !

Rhinoceros was the modeling tool for me to create an innovative hull form for a motorboat. ScheepsbouwKunst (The Art of Shipbuilding) is my bureau for maritime product development and develops the innovative motorboat. I have used Rhinoceros throughout the complete proces of design, presentation, engineering and manufacturing.

The Rhinocentre website, which I initiated, is a platform for Dutch rhino users to share knowledge and experiences.

I have been using Rhino through the last 5 years. I'm using it together with a Faro Arm. I make documentation on ship timber from Viking age, bits and pieces from Stone age and much more. We have to save our cultural inheritance, and here Rhino is weary useful. A 3D recording saved in more than 35 different layers, on a platform we distribute to other countries. The idea is to make it easier to read drawings, made in different parts of Europe, and a result of that, is an easier way to analyse all the different wrecks, found in the mud. http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk

=====Ted Kyte (<ted-cathy@ted-kyte.com>)=====

I don't suffer from Rhino phobia, I enjoy it.

Located in Southern Alberta Canada, I design rodeo and livestock equipment around the world. I have used Autocad for 20 years and tried numerous other cad packages. I heard about Rhino and downloaded the Ver 3 demo and was simply amazed at its easy of use and the UI and I bought it the next day. I am normally a hard sell, I beat stuff up for a long time before I buy it and even then very seldom do.

I currently do a lot of 3D modeling with Rhino, some for my work, but mostly just for freelance, enjoyment and for my web page.

I like the product so much that I have recently become a reseller and look forward to meeting and dealing with more Rhinophiles.

Another thing that stands out with the McNeel line of products is the support. They go way beyond the call of duty to keep customers happy.

I can't go a day without doing something with Rhino, hence the phobia...:)
