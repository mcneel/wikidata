======How Does Rhino for Mac Find a LAN Zoo Server?======

> **Summary:** //An overview of how Rhino for Mac finds a Zoo license manager server//

When Rhino needs a license from a LAN Zoo server, it determines the name of the LAN Zoo server by looking in the following locations in this order:
  - The ZooClient Settings xml file. Looks for the host name or IP address of your LAN Zoo server.
  - Queries your Domain Name System (DNS) server for the default LAN Zoo server name.


=====More information=====

==== ZooClient Settings file====

When running as a network node, Rhino determines the name of the LAN Zoo server by first looking in the **LicensesZooClient.Settings.xml** file in this folder:

=== Rhino 8 ===

<code>
/Users/Shared/McNeel//Rhinoceros/8.0/License Manager
</code>

=== Rhino 7 ===

<code>
/Users/Shared/McNeel//Rhinoceros/7.0/License Manager
</code>

===Rhino 6===

<code>
/Users/Shared/McNeel//Rhinoceros/6.0/License Manager
</code>


The settings file can be view with a text editor. The contents of this file will look similar to this:

<code>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!--Zoo client settings file written by Rhino-->
<ZooClient>
Â  <Software_McNeel_Rhinoceros_6.0_License_Manager Server="host name or IP address" />
</ZooClient>
</code>

Where: **"host name or IP address"** is the host name or IP address of your LAN Zoo server.

> **Note:** //In order for Rhino to create this file, the user running Rhino must have rights to create files in this location.//

> **Also:** //The **Software_McNeel_Rhinoceros_6.0_License_Manager** xml tag shown above is used by **all** Rhino versions, //not just Rhino 6//.//

====Using DNS===
If Rhino cannot determine the name of the Zoo server by searching in the ZooClient Settings file, it then queries your DNS server for the default Zoo server, which is the following host name:

<code>
__mcneel.__zoo5
</code>

For example, if your company's domain is //mcneel.com//, then you can add a DNS alias of //<nowiki>__mcneel.__zoo5.mcneel.com</nowiki>// which points to your Zoo server.
