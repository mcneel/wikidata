====== The Sun Tab ======

The Sun tab contains the controls for altering the parameters of the automatic sky preset. The sun is a directional light source infinitely far from the model. The controls for the sun specify its direction using spherical coordinates. **Azimuth** is a measure of horizontal rotation clockwise from north, and **Altitude** is a measure of vertical rotation up and down, where zero is at the horizon. By checking the **Specify Angles Directly** box, these values can be input manually. The other option is for nXt to automatically calculate the correct angles based on date, time, and location information.

Other sky settings in the Sun tab are:
  * **Cloudiness**
  * **Sun Intensity**
  * **Sun Highlight**
  * **Sun Channel**
  * **Sky Intensity**
  * **Skylight Saturation**
  * **Sky Channel**
