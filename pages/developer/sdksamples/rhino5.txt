=====Overview=====

If you distribute plug-ins built with the Rhino 5 C++ SDK, you need to understand the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit Rhino 5.

=====More information=====
Rhino 5 is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

  * A 32-bit C++ plug-in will not run in 64-bit Rhino 5.
  * A 64-bit C++ plug-in will not run in 32-bit Rhino 5.

=====32-bit plug-ins=====

  * A 32-bit plug-in built with the Rhino 4 C++ SDK will run in the 32-bit version of Rhino 5.
  * A 32-bit plug-in built with the Rhino 5 C++ SDK will __only__ run in the 32-bit version of Rhino 5.

What this means to 32-bit plug-in developers:

  * If you can write your 32-bit plug-in using the Rhino 4 C++ SDK, do so because it will work in both Rhino 4 and the 32-bit version Rhino 5.
  * If you need to use a new feature found in the Rhino 5 C++ SDK, then your 32-bit plug-in will __only__ work in the 32-bit version Rhino 5.
=====64-bit plug-ins=====

  * There is no 64-bit version of Rhino 4. 
  * All 64-bit plug-ins require the 64-bit version of Rhino 5.

=====Supporting new Rhino 5 features====
There are several new features available in the Rhino 5 SDK. Take advantage of them.
