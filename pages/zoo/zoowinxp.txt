===== Question =====
I am trying to get the LAN Zoo running on Windows XP. As soon as we start the Zoo on that machine, the LAN Zoo freezes up, and nothing happens. Isn't Windows XP supported for LAN Zoo?

===== Answer =====
  - The Zoo requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8.
  - The .NET Framework 4.8 and later versions are __not__ supported on Windows XP.
