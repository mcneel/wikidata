=====Level 2 Training—Rhinoceros 4.0 Course Outline (tentative) =====

===Day 1: Page 3 to 54 (L2 Chapters 1 to 4)===
Productivity Tools and
Rhino’s customization tools make it easy to create and modify toolbars and buttons. Adding to the flexibility is the ability to combine commands into macros to accomplish more complex tasks. In addition to toolbar customization, it is possible to set up command aliases and shortcut keys to accomplish tasks in Rhino.
After a brief warm-up exercise, the following concepts will be covered:
 Customize toolbars and toolbar collections
 Create simple macros
 Load and run scripts
 Load plug-ins
NURBS Concepts
Gaining an understanding of NURBS structure is useful in deciding which strategies to use when creating or editing geometry. The second part of the morning session will focus on the following concepts.
 NURBS topology
 Continuity
 Using curvature graphs

===Day 2: pages 54 to 84 (L2 Chapter 5) ===
**Surface Continuity**
The continuity characteristics for curves can also be also applied to surfaces. Rhino takes advantage of the OpenGL display capability to create false color displays for checking curvature and continuity within and between surfaces. Surface continuity concepts will be covered in the afternoon session including:
 Use of a range of strategies to build surfaces
 Rebuilding surfaces and curves
 Controlling surface curvature continuity
 Analyzing surface continuity

===Day 3: pages 86 to 120 (L2 Chapters 6 to 8) ===
**Advanced Surfacing**
A general approach to modeling is the focus of this session with the following topics discussed:
 Create surfaces and features using custom construction planes
 Group objects
 Visualize, evaluate, and analyze models utilizing shading features
 Using History
 Advanced Surfacing


===Day 4: pages 121 to 134 (L2 Chapters 9) ===
**More Advanced Surfacing**
This session focuses on some very specific modeling problems that make use of the continuity tools. Specifically making surfaces that have a crease at one that gradually changes to a smooth transition at the other end and making a cutout scoop on a free-form surface.
-->**Current Progress**

===Day 5: pages 135 to 186 (L2 Chapters 10 to 15)===
Often you are asked to take an existing design from a 2-D graphics package and include it as part of a Rhino model. In this part of the session the following techniques will be discussed:
 Place text around an object or on a surface
 Map planar curves to a surface
 Sculpting surfaces, meshing, and troubleshooting
Homework: Review Scoop Bring questions.

**Using 2D drawings and images**
In the second part of the session, making simplified surfaces and sculpting techniques will be discussed. The last part of the session will cover the following concepts:
 Surface analysis
 Introduction to blocks
 Troubleshooting
 Meshing techniques

===Day 6: pages 187 - end (L2 Chapters 16 to end) ===
**Rendering**
In the last session we will discuss rendering with both of the internal rendering application Rhino Render and the Flamingo plug-in.
The following concepts will be discussed:
 Lighting
 Making and editing materials
 Adding decals and textures
 Adjusting colors, transparency, and ambient light
 Special effects
