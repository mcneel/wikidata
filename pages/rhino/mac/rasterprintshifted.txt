====== Why is my Layout shifted when using raster printing? ======
> **Summary:** //Raster printing for some printers may be shifted out of position//
> **Note:** //This only affects Rhino for Mac Layout printing//

Some users will find that prints and PDFs created when printing from Layouts may be shifted out of place on the page. Several things can effect this:
  * Shifting only occurs when using the raster option. Vector prints are not shifted
  * Shifting can be avoided by selecting a "borderless" paper size
  * Shifting can be avoided by selecting a different current printer
  * Printing to PDF is also shifted when one of these printers is current unless a borderless paper size, or vector output is selected

This shifting issue has been seen when using some **HP DeskJet** and some **Canon printer** drivers.
