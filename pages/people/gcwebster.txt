====== Scripts, Workspace, and Macros======

Created by G.C. Webster (Guilherme Cozer Webster) for Rhino. 

> **Info:** //Olá. Welcome to my humble wiki page. I'm not a VB Expert, but I do my best. If you'd like to report a bug (or maybe a spelling / grammar mistake), send a suggestion or just contact me, feel free to send an [[gcwebster36@gmail.com|e-mail.]]//

===== VB.NET =====

This [[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/gcwebster-rhinoscripts.zip|.zip file]] (last revision: **03/Feb/06**) contains all the scripts described below, saved in **.rvb** format. It is simpler than uploading every single script...

These .rvb files are ready to be copied and pasted to a button. Take a look at the [[developer:macroscriptsetup|MacroScriptSetup]] tutorial page to know what I'm talking about.

**AbsTol** - Quickly change the absolute tolerance of a document.

**AnglePivot** - Runs the Angle command with a pivot point.

**AnnotateCrvLengths**

**AnnotateCrvRadius**

**BothColors** - Quickly changes both wireframe and render/material colors of any objects.

**ClearAllMeshes** - Runs the ClearAllMeshes command with a secure confirmation box.

**ClearUndo** - Runs the ClearUndo command with a secure confirmation box.

**ClosedPlanarCrvIndAreaCentroids** - Creates individual area centroids for each closed planar curve selected.

**CopyToPt** - Copies several objects to selected points at the same time. (Original idea by [[people:davidrutten|Gelfling aka David Rutten]])

**CSec2** - Automatically creates open curves from the intersection between given cross-section and profile curves.

**DigDisconnect** - Runs the DigDisconnect command with a secure confirmation box.

**EncloseCrvs** - Encloses open planar curves inside a closed planar curve boundary.

**ExtendCrvs** - One of the most useful scripts I've ever written: extend several curves at the same time.

**IndAreaCentroids** - Creates individual area centroids for each srf or polysrf selected.

**IndBoundingBoxes** - Creates individual bounding boxes for each object selected.

**IndProjBB** - Creates projected to Cplane bounding boxes for each object selected.

**InvBottom** - Sets an Invert Bottom view in any Rhino document.

**InvTop** - Sets an Invert Top view in any Rhino document.

**InvDel** - Simply inverts selection and deletes remaining objects with a secure confirmation box.

**OffsetCrvs** - Offsets more than one curve at the same time, including a  BothSides  option.

**OriBB** - Creates an oriented Bounding Box accordingly to a 3pt Cplane. (Thanks for the help, Pascal!)

**Orient2pt_pivot** - The orient command with a pivot point (same first point on both reference and target).

**ProjBB** - Also extremely useful: creates a Projected To Cplane Bounding Box.

**QuadMirror** - Mirror an object twice, first horizontally and then vertically, using the origin, resulting in four equal objects. (Hmmm...is this clear enough?)

**RenderColor** - Quickly changes the render/material color of objects.

**ResetBothColors** - Re-assigns both wireframe and render/material color of objects as By Layer.

**ResetColor** - Re-assigns the wireframe color of objects as By Layer.

**ResetRenderColor** - Re-assigns render/material color of objects as By Layer.

**SelCrvInPlane** - Selects only the planar curves in a model that coincides with the active CPlane.

**SelPlanar**

**SelPlanarPolysrf**

**SelPlanarSrf**

**ShowE** - All objects of the model on the screen - basically unlocks and shows everything.

**Txt2Crv** - Transforms text objects in curves.

**UndoViewChangeInAllViewports**

**WireColor** - Quickly changes the wireframe color of objects.

===== Workspace=====

[[http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/legacy/en/gcwebsterRH3_SR4.zip|Here]] it's possible to download my personal workspace file, with custom buttons and organization. It contains the macros below, all scripts above and other useful codes from some VB masters such as [[http://www.avgauge.com|Dan Bayn]] and [[http://www.rayflectar-graphics.com/Rhino/RhinoScripts-Gallery.htm|Thomas Anagnostou.]]

===== Macros=====

[[rhino:basicmacros|Macros]] are usually quite easy and simple. Here are some of mine:

**New file using template** - Just replace YOURTEMPLATE with the real name of the template wanted.


**_New YOURTEMPLATE**

**SelColor+Hide & SelColor+InvHide**

**_SelColor** 
_pause
_Hide

**_SelColor**  
_pause
_Invert
_Hide


**Set the Default layer on** - You obviously must have a layer named default.

**-_OneLayerOn Default**


**Open the Units Tab in Document Properties page**
'_NoEcho
'//DocumentPropertiesPage //Units


**Set the Gradient View ON in all viewports & Set the Gradient View OFF in all viewports**

**_NoEcho**
-GradientView
View
Enter

**_NoEcho**
-GradientView
View
State
Enter

**Show Wireframes on render & Don't show wireframes on render** - It works only with TreeFrog as the current renderer .

**_NoEcho**
-_DocumentProperties
_TreeFrog
_Wireframe=yes
//Enter //Enter

_SetRedrawOn
_Echo

**_NoEcho**
-_DocumentProperties
_TreeFrog
_Wireframe=no
//Enter //Enter

_SetRedrawOn
_Echo



**Blend curve: tangent - position continuity** - Creates a blend curve using G1 and G0 continuities in the first and last input, respectively. You can use this macro as a model to create other continuity combinations.

**_Blend**
continuity=tangency
_pause
continuity=position



**Line: Perpendicular from Curve, Both Sides from First Point**

**Line Perpendicular**
_BothSides
_pause
_FromFirstPoint



**Mark Both Curve Start and End**

**_NoEcho**
_CrvStart
_CrvEnd
