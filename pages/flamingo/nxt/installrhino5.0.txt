===Another option====
If you do not have time to download new Flamingo DVD Installer (above), you can workaround the issue by installing Rhino 4 sr9 Eval. You do not need to use it, but uninstalling is also not recommended. Download the Rhino 4 English sr9 25 save eval (03-09-2011) [[http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.na.mcneel.com/rhino/4.0/2011-03-09/eval/rh40eval_en_20110309.exe|here.]]

=====Flamingo Installation Fails with 1603 Error=====
**//Problem://** You try to install Flamingo NXT and receive this 1603 error and install fails.

**//Answer://** Download and install the [[http://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5/latest?PageSpeed=noscript|Rhino 5 32 bit eval]].
 
**//Why?//** 
This will happen on computers that do not have Rhinoceros 4 or Rhino 5 32bit. Currently the Flamingo nXt installer looks for a component in these version and will not install. As a workaround, install the Rhino 5 32bit Evaluation. 

=====Flamingo is installed, but will not run=====
**//Problem://** You run Flamingo NXT in Rhino 5 and receive an error that reads: 

“Flamingo Initialization Error- Unable to communicate with the license manager”

**//Answer://** It is likely that the license manager for Flamingo has been deleted by the Rhino 4 uninstaller.  please install one of the two files below to fix this problem:

[[http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.na.mcneel.com/flamingo/nxt/2011-03-09/release/rhinolm_20110309_x86.exe|Flamingo License manager for 32-bit Windows]]

[[http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.na.mcneel.com/flamingo/nxt/2011-03-09/release/rhinolm_20110309_x64.exe|Flamingo License manager for 64-bit Windows]]

=====Flamingo does not load with a Rhino plug-in error=====
**//Problem://** When starting up Rhino you receive this error:

"Rhino Plug-in Error for FlamingonXtNet64.rhp – A procedure imported by ArNxtToolkitDotNet64.dll could not be loaded."  

**//Answer://** Normally this is a Service release for Flamingo that did not install properly.  Uninstall the last service release using this method:

  - Uninstall Flamingo patch. You can do this in Control Panel.
  - Highlight the Flamingo nXt program and look in the upper left corner. There is an option in the left margin to "View installed updates."
  - Pick it, and from the next list highlight Flamingo NXT 3.1.2012.10.18.
  - Right click and pick Uninstall. (You can also uninstall the entire Flamingo program, but you will need to reinstall from the CD.)
  - Now open Rhino, Flamingo should load, tell me what version of Flamingo you now have.
  - Close Rhino and install the 9-11-2012. You now get it from here.
