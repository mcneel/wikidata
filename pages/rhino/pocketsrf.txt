\\

| {{:legacy:en:How_to_tutorials/Fillets/pocket/Pocket1.png}} | Extract floor surface. Offset 4 units (Fillet radius) Pipe the top edge curves (cap = no) to the same radius. Intersect the pipe and the offset. |

\\

| {{:legacy:en:How_to_tutorials/Fillets/pocket/Pocket2.png}} | Pipe the resulting curve(s) at 4. |

\\
