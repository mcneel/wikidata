===== Passes =====
There are three options for determining resolution: Viewport, Pixels, and Print. **Viewport** lets you set the number of total pixels. Accurender's default setting of 300,000 pixels is often sufficient for proofs or images going to the web, but 3,000,000 or more may be required for a final, printed image. **Pixels** lets you set resolution for both X and Y axes. 

===== Depth of Field =====
This effect creates a depth of field blur that mimics a photographer's lens. A lens can only focus precisely at one distance, but the decrease in sharpness is gradual around the focal distance, creating an area that is acceptably sharp. **Strength** controls the size of this area. A strength of zero means that the entire image is sharp. Increasing the strength makes the areas outside the focal distance more blurry and makes the area in focus smaller. **Focal Distance** sets the distance for the depth of field.
