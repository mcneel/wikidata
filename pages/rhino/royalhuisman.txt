Dutch craftsmanship

Specializing in high quality custom ‘Alustar’ aluminum and carbon composite (superstructures) yachts between 80’ and 300’, both sail and power yachts are produced.

The shipyard’s in-house engineering departments work closely with all major naval and styling architects to produce the infinite number of details found in custom yacht construction. The shipyard has gained a reputation for combining innovative engineering principles with traditional Dutch craftsmanship.

With this ‘under the one roof’ approach to yacht construction all major trades are represented at the 30.000 square m facility. From furniture hall to the adjoining [[http://www.rondal.com|Rondal]] factory for masts, hatches and deck equipment. The engineering software used at the shipyard is [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] 2006 & Autodesk Inventor Series 10 in parallel with the well established [[http://www.shipconstructor.com|ShipConstructor]] fabrication software that has been in use since 2003. With a view to being able to expand the advanced composites division, a robotic 6 axis-milling machine has proven that the computer milling at a 1:1 scale of superstructures, steering stations, hatches, keels and other complex shapes has been a great step forward. Such accurate molding will allow the Naval and Styling architects with which the yard works the opportunity to express design ideas with greater freedom.
