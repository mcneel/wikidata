====== Make Plug-ins with Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop ======
> **Summary:** //How to build and debug RhinoCommon plug-ins for Rhino with the free express editions of Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop//

Microsoft now provides free trimmed down versions of their developer products called //Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop// that support both C# and VB.NET.  

  * Microsoft Visual Studio Express for Windows Desktop (http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) 
**Note:** Make sure you download the //... for Windows Desktop// and not the //... for Windows// edition.

This product can be used to develop .NET plug-ins for Rhino. Here are some helpful steps to get you started:

----
**Download and install Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop**

Choosing between VB.NET and C# is really a matter of syntax preference. Both programming languages should be able to build the same quality of plug-ins. It just depends on the language that you feel more comfortable with. The installer downloads and installs everything you'll need to develop Rhino plug-ins. 

----
**Install the RhinoCommon plug-in project and command templates from the Visual Studio Gallery**

  * Launch VS Express 2013 for Desktop.
  * From the Visual Studio //Tools// menu select //Extensions and Updates ...//.
  * On the left select //Online// then //Visual Studio Gallery//.
  * In the //Search Visual Studio Gallery// search box (top right), type //RhinoCommon//.
  * The RhinoCommon templates extension appears in the search results.  Install it.

----
**Create a Rhino plug-in project**

  * Start VS Express 2013 for Desktop and go to File...New Project. In the //New Project// dialog expand the left most tree to //Installed/Templates/Visual Basic// or //Installed/Templates/Visual C#// depending on which language you prefer. Double-click on the //RhinoCommon plug-in// template.  Fill the required information in the Wizard dialog: make sure the RhinoCommon Reference and the Rhino EXEs have been found.  If not you'll have to browse for them manually.  When you're all done click on the //Finish// button.  You now have a plug-in project that you can work with.

----
**Compiling and debugging the plug-in**

I like to have the output window showing when I compile my projects. This way I can see what is going on. To show this window, click on Debug... Windows ... Output.

The RhinoCommon template has set things up so when you compile the solution a .rhp file is compiled in the bin subdirectory of the project directory.

From the Debug menu selecting //Start Debugging (F5)// will launch Rhino.  

If it's the first time you launch Rhino from your plug-in project you'll first need to install it:

  * At the Rhino command prompt type the PlugInManager command.
  * Click the //Install...// button to locate and install the .rhp file. 
  * Click //Ok// to close the Rhino Options dialog.

If you want to step into the code you can add break-points in your code before you run the command.

To add a new command to your plug-in:

  * Shut down Rhino.
  * Right-click your project header in Solution Explorer (in Visual Studio) and select //Add/New Item ...// from the context menu.
  * Select the //Empty RhinoCommon Command// template from the //Installed/Visual C# (or VB) Items/Rhinoceros// leftmost tree.
