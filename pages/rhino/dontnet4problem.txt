====== Rhino does not run due to .NET 4 Error ======
After installing the .NET Framework 4, programs, like Rhino that require it, still do not believe it is installed and refuse to run. 

==== This happens after installing:====
  * Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Full)
  * Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile
Both report the .NET Framework 4 installation was successful and it appears in the list of installed programs in Control Panel.

==== You may have tried:====
Rebooted and Reinstalled but nothing has worked.


==== Solution====
  - Log in as the Administrator on the computer with FULL ADMINISTRATOR RIGHTS. Individuals may have some administrator rights. However, it is not the same.
  - Use the clean-up procedure detailed in the  [[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx|.NET Framework Cleanup Tool User's Guide]].
  - After clean-up, install the [[http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851|Microsoft .NET Framework 4]].
The Microsoft .NET Framework 4 web installer package downloads and installs the .NET Framework components required to run on the target machine architecture and OS. An Internet connection is required during the installation. .NET Framework 4 is required to run and develop applications to target the .NET Framework 4.

==== Test ====
Copy this into Internet Explorer and it will report back the version of .NET.

<code html>
<html>
<body>
<button onclick="alert(navigator.userAgent);">User Agent</button>
</body>
</html>
