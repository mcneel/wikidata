====== Formulas in Dimensions ======

===== Question: =====
I’m using the default “automatic” dimension value feature (eg “<>”) when I annotate 2D objects
I want to create a detail view of a piece of a 2D object - while preserving the original dimensions.

At present, I make a copy of the 2D object, scale it as desired, and then replace the “<>” dimension properties with a hand coded dimension value. This is tedious and prone to error.

So my question is this…is there way to add a calculation to operated on the the automatic value (i.e. “<>”) of the dimension?

===== Answer: =====
If the text begins with a % and ends in a %, then python function parser considers it a //parsable// function or calculation.
There my be additional operators in python that you can try, but here are the most common.

You can use the Properties -> Text properties page or the TextEdit command to edit the Dimension Text with the following operations or calculations.

Try these:
^ Operation ^ Code ^ More ^
|Multiplication|<nowiki>%<<>*2>%</nowiki>|Multiplies <> by n|
|Division (Float) |<nowiki>%<<>/2>%</nowiki>|Divides <> by n|
|Subtraction |<nowiki>%<<>-2>%</nowiki>|Subtracts <> and n|
|Addition |<nowiki>%<<>+2>%</nowiki>|Adds <> and n|
|Square|<nowiki>%<(<>**2)>%</nowiki>|Computes the square root of <>|
|Power|<nowiki>%<(<>**X)>%</nowiki>|Raises <> to the nth power|
|Square Root|<nowiki>%<(<>**0.5)>%</nowiki>|Computes the square root of <>|
|Division (Integer)|<nowiki>%<(<>//2)>%</nowiki>|Divides <> by n|
|Modulus|<nowiki>%<(<>//2)>%</nowiki>|Divides <> by n, returns remainder|
