====== Help Videos Fail on 64-Bit Systems ======


If the Help videos do not play on 64-bit systems, you must upgrade your Flash player to Flash 11. You must do this by going to the Flash download site using your 64-bit browsers. The Help is optimized for Windows Explorer and will use Windows Explorer by default, so you should update your Flash player by going to the Flash update page in Windows Explorer 64-Bit.
