===== Question =====
I am trying to write a simple console application like the **example_write** sample included with the openNURBS toolkit. But, I am having problems linking. I'm using the **opennurbs_staticlib_linking_pragmas.h** header included with openNURBS, but it does not seem to work.

===== Answer =====
The **opennurbs_staticlib_linking_pragmas.h** header, included with openNURBS, is only designed to help build the example projects included with the toolkit. That is, it only works if your project is inside the openNURBS folder.

Unlike the #include statement, #pragma statements, used in this header, are not very //path// smart. The library paths used by #pragma statement must be relative to the project, not the #include file in which it is used.

You certainly don't have to use **opennurbs_staticlib_linking_pragmas.h** in your project. You can always add the required openNURBS libraries to your project's **Additional Dependencies** link settings. You can also just include the required libraries in your project, like you would a .cpp or .h file.

But, if you like the flexibility that providing linking instructions via **#pragma** statements provide, then you can always change **opennurbs_staticlib_linking_pragmas.h** to reflect the path to your project. But, if you use openNURBS in more than one project and the projects are not all stored in the same relative location, this will not work.

Below is a link to a zip file that contains two header files that you can include in any project that needs to link with openNURBS. One of the headers provides instruction for statically linking openNURBS, and the other one for dynamically linking. Once these files are included in your project, you can edit them to reflect your project's relative path to the openNURBS toolkit.

To use these headers, just include them to your project's **stdafx.h** file like this:

<code>
// stdafx.h

#pragma once

#include "targetver.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <tchar.h>

// TODO: reference additional headers your program requires here

// Uncomment the following if you want to use the opennurbs dynamic link library
//#define ON_DLL_IMPORTS

#include "../opennurbs/opennurbs.h"

#if defined(ON_DLL_IMPORTS)
#include "opennurbs_dynamic_linking.h"
#else
#include "opennurbs_static_linking.h"
#endif
</code>
