=====Magic what?=====

This is a little plugin for Rhino4 which attempts to link any video-provider on your computer (usually a webcam) to an emap-channel.

I've never done anything remotely like this before and chances are I made some pretty hefty mistakes. Please **SAVE** before using this plugin.

Since I live in a dark cave at the dawn of time my webcam takes a long time to capture a single frame and thus I do not know how smooth this thing can run under ideal circumstances. I suspect it's probably not too smooth. You should be able to select both surfaces and meshes for this one, but the command is not a dynamic one like _EMap. This is just a joke, I do not plan to invest any more time in (smoke and) mirrors.

This version differs from the one originally posted here. It no longer requires an additional DLL to run, the plugin is self-containing. Also, a bug was fixed that caused the command to crash when meshing failed.
