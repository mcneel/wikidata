While the Rhino End User License Agreement has not changed, we have changed how the usage is enforced in Rhino V6. 

There are now three ways to use your license:
  - Stand-alone to use Rhino **exclusively** on a single computer.
  - Floating licenses across a **company's private network** using the Zoo. [[zoo:home|For more details go here....]]
  - Share license on **multiple computers** using Cloud Zoo For Rhino 6.
    - Add your license and it will float to any computer you have access to using the Internet instead of a local area network by logging in with your Rhino Account.
    - For multiple users, use the Cloud Zoo to create teams, add multiple licenses, and invite users to join the Team to share the licenses over the internet.

We recommend using Cloud Zoo for maximum flexibility. A detailed comparison of licensing options can be found at [[https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/licensing-and-administration|Rhino 6 License and Administration]]

You can change from one licensing type to another but it is not automatic. Here is an article that covers the  [[rhino:6:change-license|Rhino 6 change license to use the Cloud Zoo process]].
