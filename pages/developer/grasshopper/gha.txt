=====Overview=====
In order to further customize [[http://www.grasshopper3d.com/|Grasshopper]]Â®, we provide a deep-reaching software development kit (SDK) that can be used to organize, create and modify geometry in novel ways. This SDK requires some knowledge of programming or scripting, and allows designers to build form generators that might otherwise be beyond beginners' possibilities.

With the Grasshopper Component SDK, you can extend Grasshopper by creating new components with direct access to Rhino and Grasshopper structures, geometry, graphics system, and much more.
