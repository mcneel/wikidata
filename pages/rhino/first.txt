=====About FIRST Robotics Competition=====
The mission of //[[http://www.usfirst.org|First]]// (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders by engaging them in exciting extra-curricular, mentor-based robotics programs that build STEM skills, inspire innovation, and foster well-rounded life skills including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.

//[[http://www.usfirst.org|First]]// is comprised of a sequence of robotics programs for young people 6 - 18 years old. Founded in 1989 by inventor [[http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/bio/dean-l-kamen|Dean Kamen]], //[[http://www.usfirst.org|First]]// is a 501(c)(3) non-profit headquartered in Manchester, NH.

Known as "the varsity sport for the mind," //First// Robotics Competition ([[http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc|FRC]]) combines the excitement of sports with the rigors of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited time and resources, student teams are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and design, build and program their team robot to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors.  Itâ€™s as close to "real-world engineering" as a student can get. Volunteers and professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. The [[http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc|FRC]] "season" begins with a January Kick-off, February-April regional events, and culminates in an April championship event.
