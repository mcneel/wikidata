====== License manager initialization failed with error -200 ======

**Problem:**\\
Rhino 6 displays this error and will not run. \\


**Solution 1:**
Run a "Repair" on the 64-bit Rhino in Control Panel > Programs and Features to correct the error.

**Solution 2:**
If you have the ShapeDiver plug-in for Grasshopper installed, find and delete the ShapeDiver folder from
%AppData%\McNeel\Rhinoceros\packages\6.0\ \\
(ShapeDiver does not cause this error for Rhino 7.)
