====== Using Numpy SciPy and other Cpython libraries in GHPython ======

There are ways to use Numpy and Scipy within the GHPyton component in Grasshopper.

GH Python Remote is a special component that lets you use regular Python code directly in the GHPython component, like importing Numpy, Scipy, matlplotib et al.  It is developed by Pierre Cuvilliers at MIT. See below for more instructions on installation and setup for Rhino 5.

COMPAS is an open-source, Python-based computational framework for collaboration and research in architecture, 
engineering and digital fabrication. It is developed by the Block Research Group (https://block.arch.ethz.ch) of 
ETH Zurich (http://www.ethz.ch).

===== CPython Remote =====

GH Python Remote is a special component that lets you use regular Python 2.7.5 code directly in the Rhino 5 GHPython component, like importing Numpy, Scipy, matlplotib et al.

Setting this up takes many steps:

  -  Install Grasshopper for Rhino 5
  -  Setup a AnaConda virtual environment running Python 2.7.5, Nunpy, SciPy etc....
  -  Install GHPython for Grasshopper
  -  Update the Rhino Python engine used by Grasshopper to the release 2.7.5
  -  Install GHPython Remote in Grasshopper
  -  Run the GhPython Remote sample
