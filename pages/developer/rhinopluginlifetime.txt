====== Understanding Rhino Plug-in Compatibility ======
In order for Rhino to successfully load and run your plug-in, several conditions must be met:

  - The RhinoSdkVersion number of your plug-in must match the RhinoSdkVersion of Rhino.
  - The RhinoSdkServiceRelease number of your plug-in must be less than or equal to the RhinoSdkServiceRelease of Rhino.

Because Rhino 5.0 32-bit is binary compatible with Rhino 4.0, the RhinoSdkVersion never changes for the Rhino 5.0 32-bit SDK. Thus, all plug-ins compiled for Rhino 4.0 and Rhino 5.0 32-bit will continue to load throughout the release cycle of Rhino 5.0.

However, we occasionally make changes to the 64-bit SDK. When we do this, we change the RhinoSdkVersion number. This will cause any existing 64-bit plug-ins on customer computers to not load.

Your customer will get this error message:
(TODO add image)

If your customer gets this message, you need to download the latest Rhino 5.0 SDK, recompile your plug-in, and release it to your customers.

For more information on automatically updating your plug-in on customer machines, read about the [[developer/mcneelupdate/overview|McNeel Update System]].
