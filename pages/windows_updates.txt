====== Checking for Windows Updates ======
Rhino and other McNeel applications install using the Microsoft Windows Installer. The Microsoft Installer uses components in Windows and requires that these components are up to date. 

If Windows is not up to date, you many get the error:

**//There is a problem with the Windows Installer Package. A DLL is required for this install to complete could not run. Contact your support personnel or package vendor.//**
