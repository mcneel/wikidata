===== Description =====
Mathematician **Henry Segerman** shared  beautiful and compelling 3D printed mathematical generated art. 
Henry generates geometry with topology and symmetry, shapes, and space. Find the mathematical meaning by creating models with hyperbolic honeycombs, twisting torus knots, and scintillating shadow geometry. 

In the second half of the presentation, he instructed the attendees in workshop format on how to make a “stereographic projection” with shadow sculpture using Rhino. 

This video is for anyone fascinated by two, three and even four dimensional mathematics in 3D models. Henry will broaden your exposure to visual mathematical ideas, generation of geometry and 3D printed mathematical models.

===== Audience =====
The first part of the presentation was aimed at anyone interested in geometric art and design. The second part was for Rhino users interested in learning a new way to have geometry interact with light and shadow. No prior mathematical experience was assumed or needed for the workshop. Rhino experience was helpful.

===== Table of Contents =====

===== Workshop =====
  * Henry used [[https://www.rhino3d.com/go/download/rhino-for-mac/wip/latest|Rhino 6 for Mac WIP]] (requires Rhino 5 for Mac key). You can use [[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-windows/6/evaluation|Rhino 6 for Windows.]]
  * [[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5/evaluation|Rhino 5 for Mac]] and [[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5.0/evaluation|Rhino 5 for Windows]] can be used but the final rendering result will vary from Henry's. 
===== The Presenter =====
{{ ::henry.jpeg?300|}}
Henry Segerman received his masters in mathematics from the University of Oxford in 2001, and his Ph.D. in mathematics from Stanford University in 2007. After post-doctoral positions at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Melbourne, he joined the faculty at Oklahoma State University in 2013. 

His research interests are in three-dimensional geometry and topology, working mostly on triangulations of three-manifolds, and in mathematical art and visualization. In visualization, he works mostly in the medium of 3D printing, with other interests in spherical video, virtual, and augmented reality. 

{{ ::book.jpg?90|}} He is the author of "Visualizing Mathematics with 3D Printing”, a popular mathematics book published by Johns Hopkins University Press in July 2016. See review here of his book Visualizing Mathematics with 3D Printing [[https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/visualizing-mathematics-with-3d-printing|here]] by Zdeňka Guadarrama, associate professor and Chair of the Department of Mathematics at Rockhurst University in Kansas City, MO.

The book is available from the publisher, [[https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/content/visualizing-mathematics-3d-printing|Johns Hopkins University Press]], with a 30% discount by using the promo code **HNAF**. You can also mail or phone your order, using this flyer. Alternatively, you can also buy it from Amazon.com.
