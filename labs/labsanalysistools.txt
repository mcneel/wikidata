=====Overview=====

The AnalysisTools plug-in is designed to import your analysis data into Rhino for visual inspection using false color analysis.  The plug-in can be used to read in result files from various analysis software to aid in further refinement of the model. The resulting analysis mesh in Rhino can be used to see 3D falsecolor plots of velocity, pressure, solar radiance, etc...

=====Advanced=====

In addition to supporting the above file formats, the AnalysisTools plug-in also supports [[developer:rhinoscript|RhinoScript]]. Thus, if your analysis data is in some other file format, you can write a script, using RhinoScript, to read your files and create analysis meshes. The RhinoScript-callable methods are documented in the **TestAnalysisTools.pdf** file included with the download.
