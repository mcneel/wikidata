======FireFly Workshop Prep======

Everyone needs to install a few applications if they don't already have them on their machines.  

The software programs we'll be using are:
  * **Rhino 5** (http://www.rhino3d.com/download/5). The latest build.
  * **Grasshopper** (http://www.rhino3d.com/download/grasshopper/1.0/wip). The latest build.
  * **Arduino** IDE 1.0.5 (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#toc2).  The installer should automatically install the necessary drivers on each machine, so it would be good to have this installed before the workshop.
  * **Firefly** 1.0.0.68 (http://fireflyexperiments.com/download/).  Just fill out the form and then download the appropriate installer for your version of Rhino (ie. 32-bit vs. 64-bit).  It's helpful to already have the Arduino software installed prior to installing this application.
  * **Weaverbird** (http://www.giuliopiacentino.com/weaverbird/).  We may use a few of these components for one or two tutorials, so it can be helpful to have the latest version of this installed.
 
Also, everyone may need to have a **webcam**.  There's a small glitch in the current Firefly build which requires you to have a webcam installed for it to run properly.  It doesn't have to be a fancy webcam... it can be a simple USB webcam if you don't have an internal webcam on your machine. But as we'll also be walking through some material on computer vision, so having an image capturing device handy is important.
