=====Environment variables=====

//Environment variables are a Windows feature that allow software manufacture to configure certain options for the operating environment of their programs//

Environment variables are created/accessed in the following way:

Right click on **My Computer**, select **Properties**, **Advanced tab**, **Environment Variables**.  They can then be added with the **New** button.  These variables may be placed in the **User** section to have different possibilities for different users, or the **System** section to act globally for all users.

**//The following variables allow one to set certain options in RhinoCAM that are not directly accessible via options from inside the program.//**

**VMILL_HFINISH_LEVELFIRST** - 1/0 - Allows Level first machining in Horizontal Finishing\\
\\
**VMILL_ZTRANS_FFACTOR** - [0.1-1.0] – Scales federates for plunge Z motions between Z levels in 2-1/2 axis operations\\
\\
**VMILL_SORT_PROFILES** – [1/0] – Sorts profiles based on minimum distance to each other if set to 1\\
\\
**VMILL_DORETRACT_TABLEROTATE** – [1/0] - Does retract to toolchange position before performing the table rotate if set to 1\\
\\
**VMILL_BEEP_TYPE** - [0/1/2] 0 – Waveform beep, 1 – computer beep, 2 – No beep\\
\\
**VMILL_LICENSE_HOST** – [IP Address] – Set to IP address of machine that has the network dongle for network licensing\\
\\
**VMILL_DISPLAYTOOLTIP** - [1/0] - Displays a point at the tool tip during simulation if set to 1\\
\\
**VMILL_TOOLPATH_THICKNESS** – [0.1-10.0] – [[rhino:opengl|OpenGL]] thickness value for displaying toolpath using thick lines

=====Using the user defined tool tab to create custom tools=====

//Question// - How is the user defined tool tab in the tool definition setup used? Is it possible to generate custom profile tools using this feature in RhinoCam from tool drawings?

//Answer// - User defined tools can be created and used in RhinoCAM in 2-1/2 axis profiling operations only. To create a user defined tool follow these steps:

1. Draw the profile of the tool in the XY plane (only to the centerline, i.e. half profile)

2. Make sure the starting point is at 0,0

3. In RhinoCAM 2.0, select the profile of the tool created in the XY plane, from the Rhino menu bar use File->Export Selected and save this as a Rhino (*.3dm) file. Make sure that this is the only region in the file before exporting. This file will be the tool profile file.

//In RhinoCAM 1.0, save the file as .mrg (using export region in the file menu).//

4. In RhinoCAM 2.0, from the Cutting Tools Browser under the Create/Select Tools menu – select User Defined Mill tool.

//In RhinoCAM 1.0, in the Create/Select Tools menu – select User Defined Mill tool.//

5. Select a name for the user-defined tool and enter the relevant information and comments. Parameter for the tool diameter should be twice the profile radius. You can also input a different tool diameter if you need a different size tool. The system computes the tool diameter as the twice largest X coordinate in the tool profile. It will then scale the profile by (input diameter/computed diameter). Example: if the input diameter is same as computed diameter then the scale factor is one.

6. Provide the path to the user-defined tool profile file

7. Save as a new tool

Use the tool in 2-1/2 axis profiling operations.

=====To capture the active window with an image in RhinoCAM:=====
ScreenCaptureToFile and ScreenCaptureToClipboard work fine in RhinoCAM to capture the active window with an image of a RhinoCAM simulation. ViewCaptureToFile/Clipboard, do not, however.

=====How to display a "Tool Guide" in VisualMill:=====
Go in to your registry, open up HKEY_CURRENT_USER folder , scroll down to the "Software" folder and open it. Next find "Mecsoft Corporation" folder open that. Find the "settings" folder , open it up. Find the "DisplayToolAtCursor" reg_dword, double click it and change the value data from a 0 to a 1.

Now it will display whatever tool you have loaded while making a boundary or creating geometry.
