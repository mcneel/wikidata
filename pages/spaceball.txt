A statement from [[https://www.3dconnexion.com/|3Dconnexion]]: 

//I think you should know 3Dconnexion’s approach when a device becomes obsolete: we stop testing. That’s it. We don’t remove (or add) code to our software that in any way will specifically block a device type just because software support has ended.//

//What we do is provide customers with a notice with a clear date until software support is available. This notice is issued years in advance as you can see in the web page you linked to: the page is updated when a device enters “end-of-life”.//

Any additional questions or comment should be directed to [[https://www.3dconnexion.com/service/technical-support.html|3Dconnexion Technical Support]].
