==== Classroom ====
  * Each ART candidate will need to be at a computer that is acceptable to run **Rhinoceros 7 for Windows**. The Rhino minimum system requirements are [[https://www.rhino3d.com/7/system-requirements/|here]]. You will also need a good Internet connection and mic/speakers or a headset with mic for the GoToTraining. 
  * **Rhino for Windows** will be used by the instructor during the training. 
  * //Rhino for Mac// is ok, and it will be briefly discussed. But you will need to be able to keep up with the Windows presentation.
  * The **Rhinoceros 7 for Windows 90 Day Evaluation** is available for download [[https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-windows/7/evaluation|here]].
  * All session will be recorded for your review and study. Recordings are generally posted the day of the session.
  * **Attendance for the live training is mandatory**.

==== Goal: ====
This course will concentrate on how to teach Rhino.
How to make users more successful in a short time and without the pain of trial and error.
We will not cover in detail each part of Rhino, still the Level I and II guides will be the main reference.

The following is a list of topics that will be discussed during the course.
  * A welcome from McNeel North America

  * New Rhino licensing tools
  * Level I and II basic courses
  * One on one training versus class training. Getting to know your pupils.
  * Class setup (windows / Mac)
  * Level I training: the most important one. A good start for an excellent user.
  * Why Rhino. Where the program sits in a project’s workflow.
  * Interface basics for the end user.
  * Precision modeling.
  * Making good curves.
  * More complex Curve handling.
  * Keeping your project under control: layers organizations and templates.
  * Surfaces in Rhino.
  * “Solids” how to use in a NURBS environment.
  * Surfacing tools. Which ones and in what sequence.
  * Meshing for visualization versus meshing for Rapid Prototyping.
  * Present a Helpful Level I course: Make simple but controlled objects.
  * Boolean explained. What could go wrong.
  * NetworkSrf a close look and caveat.
  * Surfacing in depth (Level II). Comparing different techniques.
  * The Approach to Modeling: How do objects made with different techniques compare? Advanced ways to analyze objects.
  * Fillets
  * Annotations and Layouts
  * UDT
  * Implicit History
  * From Implicit to Explicit History aka Grasshopper
  * While we do not require our ARTs to have a specific knowledge in Grasshopper or any other programming language, it would be good to provide the end users a minimal information about what Grasshopper is.
