====== How do I manually animate a viewport like in Bongo 1.0? ======

In Bongo 2.0 you can only see the objects that has been animated in the Animation Manager, so in order to be able to activate the animation in a viewport, you need to do the following:

Go to Bongo Menu > Bongo View Constraints Manager.

This will open the Views docking window and the selected vieport will show up as activated in the Animation Manager.
