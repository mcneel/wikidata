Are you looking to become a **Certified Rhino Specialist**? We offer certifications for experts and educators.
Certifications are a way to test knowledge and competency in Rhino software and in 3D visualization. Typically, proficiency with these Rhino skills allow Rhino users to excel and develop more advanced skills, build a greater understanding of advanced concepts, and continue advancing in their knowledge of 3D visualization.

The Certified User exams are online, computer-scored, randomized, limited time, self-tests. 

**Why certify?**

  * Certification exams measure knowledge and competency with Rhino software. The exams are offered in a professional setting administered by a company's representative or in a non-proctored environment for self-evaluation.
  * Rhino Certification is helpful by many employers.
  * Add the certificate to your resume or work portfolio, to show that you have Rhino expertise.
