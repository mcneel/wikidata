=====Problem=====
I get "Error 1935. An error occurred during the installation of assembly "Microsoft.VC80.CRT, ..."

=====Cause====
The Microsoft C++ 2005 Redistributable Package has never been installed or failed in an earlier attempt. This is a problem with Windows and the Microsoft Redistributable Package, not with Rhino's installer. However the Rhino is unable to successfully finish. Sometime is it only the 64 bit that will not complete the install.


=====Answer=====
You will need to install the redistribute the **[[http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=26347|Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update]]**. Note, the version of these assemblies are **8.0.50727.5592** or **8.0.50727.6195**.

  - **[[http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=26347|Go to the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update page]]**
