======Authoring Rhino Installer Files=====
===== Creating your first installer=====
  - Compile your plug-in.
  - Add your plug-in to a Zip archive.
  - Change the extension from .ZIP to .RHI (Rhino Installer Package).

That's all there is to it! Run your RHI to install it.

===== A more complex plug-in =====
====Goal ====
  * Install an older version of the plug-in for Rhino 4.0
  * Install a new version of the plug-in for 32-bit Rhino 5
  * Install a plug-in for 64-bit Rhino 5
  * Include a "MyToolbar.rhp" custom toolbar file

==== Organize the files====
  - Create a "Installer Image" folder (In this example, the folder is the name of the product: Marmoset.) This folder will contain only the files you want to install on the user's system.
<code>
Marmoset\
  Rhino 4.0\
    Marmoset.rhp
  Rhino 5.0\
    x86\
      Marmoset.rhp
    x64\
      Marmoset.rhp
  Common\
    Marmoset.rui
    Marmoset.chm
</code>

====Create the RHI file====
  - Copy the appropriate files into the folders. Note that all three versions of the plug-in can have the same name, so long as they are in different folders.
  - Compress the three files using zip compression (currently other compression algorithms are not supported).
  - Change the extension from .zip to .rhi

===== Everything but the kitchen sink=====
Because the Rhino Plug-in Installer Engine unzips your .rhi file into a directory specific to your plug-in, you can include anything you want: help files, documentation, etc. But you can only install things inside your own plug-in directory. So long as your .rhi file contains sub folders, everything will install correctly.

===== Running the installer =====
  - Double-click the .rhi file
  - Follow the steps in the Rhino Installation Wizard to install the plug-in.
