====== Workshop: Introduction to Rhino for Architecture  ======
===== Rhino in Architecture Course =====

  * Session 1 and 2: 9 AM - 5 PM (7 hrs)
  * Session 3 and 4: 9 AM - 5 PM (7 hrs)
  * Session 5 and 6: 9 AM - 5 PM (7 hrs)
  * Session 7 and 8: 9 AM - 5 PM (7 hrs)

**Total: 4 Days (28 hours.)**

===== Course Outline =====
In this comprehensive 3-day class you'll learn to create and edit accurate and some free-form 3-D NURBS models of a variety of architectural examples. Basic techniques for creating and editing architectural elements (like wall, door windows, roofs, stairs, roofs, terrain) from precise plans. Models will be rendered and set up in Layouts for presentations. Generating 2D plans, sections and elevations from the 3D model will also be covered. 

==== Topics ====

  *  Modeling Architecture elements like walls, doors, windows, roofs, mullion, decks, stairs.
  *  Adding Details and entourages like furniture, lights.
  *  Creating the re-usable blocks/context
  *  Parametrize your design with Grasshopper
  *  Rendering: Lighting, Materials Texture Mapping
  *  Rendering Engines: Rhino Render and Flamingo
  *  Landscape with Flamingo and Lands
  *  Present your designs with screen capturing, rendering, and layouts
  *  Additional topics if time permits: Terrain, zDepth, Polyhedron plugin, and PanelingTools


==== Structure ====

In this class, you will start with a simple models and move systematically to more complicated geometry.  In the first part of class will emphasis will be on using Rhino to generate the models. 
The second part of class will show the value of add-ons in when developing architectural models. Groups, Blocks, import, export, Make2D, Layouts will also be covered. 

==== Plugins: ====

  * The Flamingo render plugin will be used for architecture rendering and site elements like trees.  
  * The Lands WIP plugin will be used for importing terrain, site elements like streetlights and benches and vegetation like trees.
  * The VisualARQ will be used later in class as an alternative to using simply Rhino. Doors and Windows libraries, easy of adding, moving and deleting, automatic stair generation. 2D documents like sections, plans and elevations.
  * Grasshopper for Limited Designer Features

==== Prerequisites ====

  * Rhinoceros Level 1 or equivalent. We will assume the student can efficiently navigate the Rhino application and model, create curves surface and solids. Edit curves, surface and solids. 
  * Helpful: some familiarity with dimensions, text, and layouts.

==== Expected Outcomes ====
After this course the student is expected to be able to:
  * Input and edit curves in imperial and metric units.
  * Generate surface and solids from the curves precisely and in the orientations.
  * Add doors and windows, stairs, decks, railings and other arch details into the model.
  * Add materials, lights and render Interior and Exterior with Rhino and Flamingo.
  * Add terrain and trees with Lands Design.
  * Develop a model with VisualARQ.
  * Setup model for presentation in a Layout with dimension, text and rendering.
