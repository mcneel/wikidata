======Convert a Rhino That Uses the Zoo to a Standalone License======

=====Question=====
I have mistakenly installed one of my Rhino seats to use the Zoo, when I really intended to install it as a standalone  license. When I launch Rhino and go to the **Licenses** page in the **Options** dialog, the **Convert** button is disabled. I have logged in as administrator and tried again, but the button is still disabled. How do I change this installation into a standalone node?
