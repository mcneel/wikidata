====== Class Prefixes in the Rhino .NET SDK ======

=====Question=====
What is the difference between all of the .Net SDK class prefixes. I see

  * On...
  * IOnN...
  * MRhino...
  * IRhino...

Can someone please give me a brief rundown of what all these mean and what they might signify the class is used for?

=====Answer=====
The Rhino .NET SDK is a wrapper around the Rhino C++ SDK. For whatever reason, Microsoft choose not to implement the concept of **const** in the .NET framework. In C++, when modifying a data declaration, the **const** keyword specifies that the object or variable is not modifiable, or is constant. Thus, whenever you see a class name prefixed with an **I**, such as **IRhinoObject**, you will know that this is an object that cannot be modfied.
