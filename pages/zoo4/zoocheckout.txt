===== Question =====
I am trying to check out a license from my Zoo server using Rhino's CheckOutLicense command. But, I keep getting the following error:

//Unable to checkout license from license manager. Please contact your system administrator.//

===== Answer =====
In order to check out a license from a Zoo server, the license checkout feature must be enabled. By default, it is disabled.
