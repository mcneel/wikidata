====== Mitch's Second Challenge ======

> **Summary:** //Here's another example sent in my Mitch Heynick.  I'll admit, this one stumped me but Pascal figured it out. Mitch writes: Fillet all the surfaces except bottom with a constant radius of 5.  --Mitch//

There is not an obvious way to cleanly fill this, especially as a fillet. The hard part is that the horizontal fillets along the top on either side of the gap are not in line with one another. To accomodate this step back, there needs to be a surface stepping back from the angled face to the large vertical face. Undo. |

These are marked a, b, c. An easy way to do this is to make a polyline and extrude it.|

The important surfaces are the small segment of sphere at the corner and the edge fillet that goes back into the original shape along the top surface. Extract these surfaces. |

Extract and untrim all the fillets that converge on the troublesome corner including the long fillet from the temporary object. Some of these will be very long. (Note: I have trimmed them back a little in this file to clear the view.) Delete the rest of this object.  Extract and untrim the large vertical front face (Black). |

Then the untrimmed fillets, the front face retrimmed, and all joined up. Only a very small piece of the long 'dummy' fillet is actually used, along with some of the corner sphere. I found it easier to delete the bottom surfaces and then Cap the object when everything else was joined up.  -PG. |
