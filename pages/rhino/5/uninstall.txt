====== Manually uninstalling Rhino 5.0 ======
\\
====Problem:====
During the removal of Rhino, you get an error message like "Can't Uninstall - Feature is unavailable (path)"

====Applies to:====
Rhino 5

====Cause:====
The Windows Installer cache cannot find a file required for uninstall.
====Resolution:====
Manually remove Rhino and the Windows Installer registration for the product.

===Try standard Program Uninstall==
  - Go to Windows Start menu
  - Select Control Panel
  - Select Add/Remove programs
  - Find any Rhinoceros 5 entries and select uninstall


**Note:** You should only do the following procedures if uninstall fails from the Programs and Features section of Control Panel.

  
===Stop the McNeel Update Service===
  - From the **Start** menu, click **Control Panel**, then click **Administrative Tools**.
  - In Administrative Tools, double-click **Services**.
  - In the Services dialog, scroll down to **McNeel Update (32-bit)** (On 64-bit computers, you may have McNeel Update (64-bit) instead, or both, depending on which versions of Rhino 5 you have installed).
  - Right-click **McNeel Update (32-bit)**, then click **Stop**.
  - On 64-bit Windows, also stop the **McNeel Update (64-bit)** service.
  
===Delete the Rhino install folder:===
  - Browse to C:\Program Files\ folder and delete the Rhinoceros 5 directory.
  - Browse the C:\Program Files (x86)\ folder and delete the Rhinoceros 5 directory.
  - Delete **Rhinoceros 5.0 WIP** folder also if you find it in either of the above directories.
  - Note that you might not be able to delete "RhinoShExt.dll". That's ok. Leave the system folder with that one file and delete everything else.
  
===**Delete Registry Keys**===
  - Open the **Registry Editor:**
    - //On Windows XP:// From the **Start menu**, click **Run**, then **type RegEdit and press Enter**.
    - //On Windows Vista and Windows 7:// Click the **Start** button, then **type RegEdit and press Enter**.
