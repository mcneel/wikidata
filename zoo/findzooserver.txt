======How does Rhino 5 find a Zoo Server?======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:zoo5|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //An overview of how Rhino 5 finds a Zoo 5 license manager server.//

=====Overview=====
Unlike Rhino 4.0, which could automatically locate a Zoo 4.0 server if it was on the same subnet, Rhino 5 needs to know the name of your Zoo 5 server.

When Rhino 5 needs a license from a Zoo 5 server, it determines the name of the Zoo 5 server by looking in the following locations in order:
  - Looks in the Current User hive of the Windows Registry for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server.
  - Looks in the Local Machine hive of the Windows Registry for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server.
  - Queries your Domain Name System (DNS) server for the default Zoo server name.
 

=====More Information=====

====Registry Lookup - Local Machine====
If you are using a 32-bit version of Windows, then when searching in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, of the Windows Registry, for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server, Rhino 5 32-bit will look in this location:

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager
Name:  Server
Type:  REG_SZ
Value: <host name or IP address>
</code>

If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, then when searching in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, of the Windows Registry, for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server, __both__ Rhino 5 32-bit and Rhino 5 64-bit will look in this location:

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager
Name:  Server
Type:  REG_SZ
Value: <host name or IP address>
</code>

====Registry Lookup - Current User====

When searching in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, of the Windows Registry, for the host name or IP address of your Zoo server, both Rhino 5 32-bit and Rhino 5 64-bit will look in this location:

<code>
Hive:  HKEY_CURRENT_USER
Key:   Software\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\License Manager
Name:  Server
Type:  REG_SZ
Value: <host name or IP address>
</code>

====Using DNS====
If Rhino 5 fails to determines the name of the Zoo 5 server, by searching in the Windows Registry, then it will query your DNS server for the default Zoo server, which is the following host name:

<code>
__mcneel.__zoo5
</code>

For example, if your company's domain is "mcneel.com", then you can add a DNS alias of <nowiki>"__mcneel.__zoo5.mcneel.com"</nowiki> which points to your Zoo server.
