> **Summary:** //How to build and debug RhinoCommon plug-ins for Rhino with the free express editions of Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop//

Microsoft now provides free trimmed down versions of their developer products called "Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop" that support both C# and VB.NET.  

  * Microsoft Visual Studio Express for Windows Desktop (http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) NOTE: Make sure you download the "... for Windows Desktop" and not the "... for Windows" edition.

This product can be used to develop .NET plug-ins for Rhino. Here are some helpful steps to get you started:

----
**Download and install Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop**

Choosing between VB.NET and C# is really a matter of syntax preference. Both programming languages should be able to build the same quality of plug-ins: it just depends on the langauge that you feel "more" comfortable with. The installer downloads and installs everything you'll need to develop Rhino plug-ins. 

----
**Install the RhinoCommon plug-in project and command templates from the Visual Studio Gallery**

  * Launch VS Express 2013 for Desktop
  * From the Visual Studio "Tools" menu select "Extensions and Updates ...".
  * On the left select "Online" then "Visual Studio Gallery"
  * In the "Search Visual Studio Gallery" search box (top right) type RhinoCommon
  * The RhinoCommon templates extension appears in the search results.  Install it.

----
**Create a Rhino plug-in project**

  * Start VS Express 2013 for Desktop and go to File...New Project. In the "New Project" dialog expand the left most tree to "Installed/Templates/Visual Basic" or "Installed/Templates/Visual C#" depending on which language you prefer and double-click on the "RhinoCommon plug-In" template.  Fill the required information in the Wizard dialog: make sure the RhinoCommon Reference and the Rhino EXEs have been found.  If not you'll have to browse for them manually.  When you're all done click on the Finish button.  You now have a Plug-in project that you can work with.

----
**Compiling and Debugging the plug-in**

I like to have the output window showing when compiling my projects. This way I can see what is going on. To show this window, click on Debug... Windows ... Output.

The RhinoCommon template has set things up so when you compile the solution a .rhp file is compiled in the bin subdirectory of the project directory.

From the Debug menu selecting "Start Debugging (F5)" will launch Rhino.  

If it's the first time you launch Rhino from your plug-in project you'll first neet to install it:

  * At the Rhino command prompt type the PlugInManager command
  * Click the "Install..." button to locate and install the .rhp file. 
  * Click "Ok" to close the Rhino Options dialog.

If you want to step into the code you can add break-points in your code before you run the command.

To add a new command to you plug-in:

  * Shutdown Rhino
  * Right-Click your project header in Solution Explorer (in Visual Studio) and select "Add/New Item ..." from the context menu
  * Select the "Empty RhinoCommon Command" template from the "Installed/Visual C# (or VB) Items/Rhinoceros" leftmost tree.
