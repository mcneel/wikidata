====== What do you do with Rhino? Edit this page to tell the world how you use Rhino. ======

I use Rhino to model chemical research equipment - build the space available first and then use Rhino to create layouts for constructability, ergonomics, and concept discussions for small reactors, laboratory test equipment and then use the 2D layouts for job instructions/dimensions for bid and construction.  It' not high quality graphics/rendering that are so useful to me but rather getting a 3D concept out in front of stakeholders to discuss and refine the designs - and then go quickly to 2D dimensioning and bid packages.   Rhino is a great tool for this work which is usually fast track with a project time line of a month or two. Paul Worley, Lake Jackson, TX.

Rhino plays a major role in the rapid prototyping services and training courses we offer for the jewellery industry. I run a jewellery technology specialist company called [[http://www.h3-d.com/|H3-D]] . Based in the middle of London's old jewellery district, we provide CAD services, independent advisory, and education for professional jewellers and product desiginers.

I love Rhino so much I've rewritten McNeel's level 1 and level 2 Rhino training courses for jewellery designers and rapid prototyping, and had them recertified by McNeel themselves. The goal of this was to help Hatton Garden maintain a professional standard of training for its designers and manufacturers. Since the start of our partnership with [[http://www.holtsacademy.com/|Holts Academy of Jewellery]] in 2006, we have trained more than 200 jewellers, silversmiths, sculptors, and artists from all walks of life in the use of CAD and rapid prototyping for commercial ends.

The adoption of CAD technologies in jewellery design has made it possible to increasingly

refine the systems and methods for producing jewels, at times complex.

The contribution of third parties has permitted the development of software applications

additional to 3D modelling software, which allow the creation of real digital sculptures.

This report will present some of the techniques and instruments that allow jewellery

designers to create objects of various complexities using specific plug-ins and new

hardware peripherals capable of modifying complex solids or of acting on digital models

using instruments such as the chisel, gouge and, more in general, all the instruments

employed by sculptors to modify a clay model until completion of the form.

Modeled in Rhino Rendered in Flamingo. This design is unique. I specially created sweeping curves blending the Bracelet to the Case creating a perfect harmony of Case and Bracelet. This design serves well to emphasise the free-form surface creation that Rhino provides. The bracelet segments have a perfect hinge system, more characteristic of the Goldsmithing Trade (much to the disgust of my Swiss Watchmaker friends!), I have started to encourage the young generation of Swiss Watch Designers to look beyond the limits of traditional watch design, to pioneer with me a fresh new generation of asthetically advanced shapes and forms, that are closer to scuplture than traditional Swiss-time-piece manufacture. The cost factor to produce such pieces commercially is rather prohibitive as each link has a unique shape, so don't expect to see such watches arrive on the market very soon, when they do, they will not be in the lower price bracket.

NORCAST S.L. is a company that uses the newest technologies in the

ancient art of jewelry. One of the techniques our approach to jewelry

frequently uses is the fast prototyping (prototipación o prototipado

rápido de joyas, in Spanish) that allows the customer to get an

inmediate vision of the product he or she is going to get
