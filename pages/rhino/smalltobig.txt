====== Existing small radius ======
> **Summary:** //When working with multiple fillet radii, we start with the largest values first and progress in order, to the smallest fadius, to avoid running a fillet off the edge of a surface it is following. This tutorial shows a technique to use when an existing smaller fillet is complicating things.//

\\

| {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/How_to_tutorials/Fillets/Small_to_Big/SmallToBig01.png}} | Run FilletEdge with 4mm.  It will do what it can and fail. |

\\

| {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/How_to_tutorials/Fillets/Small_to_Big/SmallToBig02.png}} | Extract the two 4mm surfaces, and the 3mm surface. |

\\

| {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/How_to_tutorials/Fillets/Small_to_Big/SmallToBig03.png}} | Split the red surface by isocurve where it intersects the edge of the 4mm filet surface. |

\\

| {{http://en.wiki.mcneel.com/content/upload/files/How_to_tutorials/Fillets/Small_to_Big/SmallToBig04.png}} | Delete the top piece of the 3mm surface. |

\\

\\

\\
