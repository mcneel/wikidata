> **Products:** //[[zoo:zoo4|Zoo 4.0]], [[zoo:home|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses how multiple sessions of Rhino are licensed by the Zoo.//

=====Question=====
If the Zoo has 4 licenses available, for example, and one user starts Rhino 4 times on his computer, are all 4 licenses used?

=====Answer=====
No, a single license would be assigned to all 4 sessions of Rhino. A Zoo license is assigned to a computer/user, not to a running sessions of Rhino.

The Zoo allow multiple sessions of Rhino to be used by one user on one computer.
