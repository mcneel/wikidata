====== Brazil r/s 2.0 for Rhino Wish List ======

> **Summary:** //Post your bestest wishes here//

And where is the Help document for the decal?..

Just post more tutorials for lighting. That is crazy important for newbie.

And please make the  light target  able to be directly moved. That would be much better and it's easier to setup lights!:)

High quality soft shadows in a simple way!

A simple way to adjust level of softness and quality; two sliders, "soft-hard" and "quality high-low".

Tutorials, tutorials, tutorials.

The images available on the web are fantastic.

A little help for us newbies to get there as well would be so valuable.

Thanks from the BAFX+Ltrain Studio.

Well, fractal generated plants will be highly appreciated, or any type of plants.

Any chance this will be ported to the Mac version of Rhino that's under development?
