===== Additional Equipment =====
Phone headset or speakers is all you need for this event. Speakers or head phones use the VoIP technology, not the phone line. So this is completely free audio through your internet connection.

//Your standard phone rates apply if you use the phone number provided by the GoToWebinar Conference Call Service.//

For most events, we will be using the Question/Answer chat pane in the GoToWebinar control panel. Questions should be posted there for staff to answer while the event is being broadcast. We will review the questions and answers that come up at the end of the webinar.
