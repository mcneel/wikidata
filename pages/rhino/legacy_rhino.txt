====== Running Legacy Rhino On An Older Computer ======

===== Problem:  =====
When you upgrade your legacy Rhino to a current version, the new version may not be support some of your plugins, add-ons, scripts, output devices like laser cutters and more.

For example, users with older lasers that could print directly from **Rhino 5** on Windows 7, but however running the same **Rhino 5** on Windows 10 cannot. 

===== Solution:=====
==== Rhino 5 ====
  * Leave **Rhino 5** on the old computer that runs the legacy laser or plug-in.
  * However, you will need a new computer that runs Windows 10 for your new license of **Rhino 7** or later. 

//While the older Rhino software will not run on your new computer, your newer Rhino software will also not run well on your older computer. This is why you need to keep both computers.//

==== Rhino 6 ====
If you require access to your **Rhino 6** after you have upgraded, you will need to licence your **Rhino 6** with the [[https://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/home/cloud-zoo|CloudZoo]] method. You will be able to continue using **Rhino 6**, even after you have upgrade to a **Rhino 7** or later.

//Note:// You will be allowed to run both on the same computer, 
However, you can not run **Rhino 6** on one computer, while running **Rhino 7** on another.
