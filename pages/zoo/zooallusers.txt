====== Setup LAN Zoo for All Users ======

> **Summary:** //Instruction for setting up the LAN Zoo for all users on a Rhino for Windows client computer//

===== Issue =====
I have several users on a Rhino for Windows client computer. I have to set the LAN Zoo server IP/name in every user. Can I set up the LAN Zoo server once for all users?

===== Cause =====
When you use a double-click to run Rhino and set the LAN Zoo server, the LAN Zoo server information is added to Windows Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER. **This is for the current user only.**

===== Solution =====
Right-click on the Rhino shortcut icon, select **Run as administrator** and set the LAN Zoo server. The LAN Zoo server information is added to Windows Registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. **This is for all users.**
