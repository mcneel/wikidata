====== Setup the Zoo for all users ======

===== Issue =====
I have several users on a Rhino for Windows client computer. I have to set the Zoo server IP/name in every user. Can I set the Zoo server once for all users?

===== Cause =====
When you use a double-click to run Rhino and set the Zoo server, the Zoo server information is added to Windows Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER. **This is for the current user only.**

===== Solution =====
Right-click the Rhino shortcut icon, select **Run as administrator** and set the Zoo server. The Zoo server information is added to Windows Registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. **This is for all users.**
