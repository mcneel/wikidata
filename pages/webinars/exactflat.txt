==== The Presentation ====

Join **Mark Jewel** and **Luke Niwranski** of **[[www.exactflat.com|ExactFlat]]** for an overview of digital patterning and the ExactFlat plugin for Rhino for Windows.  They will show how ExactFlat works to flatten a number of products like a backpack, fire bowl, and other examples. 

//This webinar is for anyone designing in 3-D and needing to “flatten” the model into an accurate 2-D cut design.//  This is especially serious in  the automotive, furniture, accessories and marine industries.
