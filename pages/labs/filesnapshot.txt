====== FileSnapShot ======

{{:labs:file_dia_log.jpg|}}

**FileSnapShot** is a utility which functions similarly to the Rhino **IncrementalSave** command. It automatically saves a copy of the current model to a new, incrementally numbered file, (the snapshot) while keeping the original file open.

====More details...====

   * **FileSnapShot** writes out the current file to a unique and automatically incrementing file name. It determines the last number used in a previous FileSnapShot and properly increments it for the new file name.
   * **//File successfully written as <drv:\path\filename 00x.3dm//** The drive and path are the location of the current file, and the file name is decorated with an automatically incrementing number.
  * This number is incremented properly, even if the file is closed and opened during an subsequent editing session.
  * **FileSnapShot** will not ask if you to type in a number or if you want to overwrite a file.  
  * **FileSnapShot** uses the SaveSmall option by default, but that may be configured by running **FileSnapShot.**  
  * If the files has not been saved prior to using the **FileSnapShot** command, Rhino will prompt you to save first with the following message: // â€œThis file has never been saved. Rhino cannot save a snapshot from an unsaved file."//
  * FileSnapShot is available in 32-bit for Rhino 4/Rhino 5 and 64-bit for Rhino 5.
