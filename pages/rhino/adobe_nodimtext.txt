====== Dimension Text Does Not Display in 64-bit Rhino 5 ======

Several Rhino users have recently reported and figured out this issue. The problem turns out to be Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended.
Apparently Adobe is doing an OpenGL text grab that is messing up the Rhino display. The work-around is to go into the Acrobat tool and remove Rhino from the list of 3D applications.
