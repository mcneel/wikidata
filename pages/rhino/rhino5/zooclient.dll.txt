Rhino 5 32-bit was not affected in these cases.\\ {{http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/rhino/5/zooclient_dll.png}}


=====Cause=====

Rhino 5 doesn't have enough permission privileges to interact with the ZooClient.dll.

\\

====Solution 1====
  - Download and install the Rhino V5 **Full version** from http://www.rhino3d.com/download. This includes an **updated installer** and the current Service Release. The original DVD release of Rhino 5 did not include these improvements.

====Solution 2====
  - Right-click on the Rhino 5 shortcut icon on the desktop and select **Properties**.\\ <color #999999>The changes will be applied to the Rhino 5 executable, not the shortcut itself.</color> 
  - On the **Compatibility** tab, select **Windows 7** compatibility mode.
  - Check **Run this program as an administrator**.\\ {{http://wiki.mcneel.com/_media/rhino/5/rhino5x64properties.png?300}}
