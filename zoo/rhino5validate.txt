======Adding Rhino 5 licenses to the Zoo======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:zoo5|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Discusses adding and validating Rhino 5 licenses with the Zoo.//

=====Overview=====
When you add a Rhino 5 license to the Zoo, you will be asked to validate the license online. Rhino 5 licenses must be validated before they can be used.

<color red>**Critical: if you are upgrading to Rhino 5, you need to keep track of which previous version CD-Key you used to upgrade. You can only use each previous version CD-Key once.**</color>

The only piece of information used during license verification is your CD-Key, which is included when you buy Rhino. 

Registration is not required, nor is any personal information. No computer-specific information, or information derived from your computer is sent to Robert McNeel & Associates. 

=====Adding a Rhino license=====
To add a license to the Zoo, run the **Zoo Administrator** (ZooAdmin.exe), and then click **Edit â†’ Add**.
