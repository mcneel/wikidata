====== Rhino 5.0 SDK Enhancements ======
Rhino 5.0 has several new object types and SDK features. Be sure your plug-in supports them appropriately.

===== New Object Types =====
==== Extrusion Objects ====
Extrusion objects allow creation of simple extruded shapes using a much more lightweight representation than BRep (polysurface) objects.

Be sure your plug-in can handle these extrusion objects. Download our sample models with extrusion objects in them.

If your plug-in does not properly handle the objects in these example files, read [[/developer/rhino/5/sdkfeatures/extrusion|Supporting Extrusion Objects in C++ Plug-ins]].

==== Double Precision Meshes ====
Rhino supports double precision meshes. This allows mesh computations to be more accurate, and also enables display of objects that are very far from the origin (for example, architectural or civil engineering models using state-plane coordinate systems).

Rhino handles conversion between single-precision and double-precision automatically as needed.

If your plug-in needs enhanced accuracy or support for very large coordinates, read [[/developer/rhino/5/sdkfeatures/doubleprecisionmesh|Supporting Double Precision Meshes in C++ Plug-ins]]

==== New Annotation Features ====
Dimension styles, text, and hatches support scale factors. Rhino also supports scaling for the model-space viewports and in each layout.

If your plug-in needs to support these new features, please contact our developer support group for more details.
