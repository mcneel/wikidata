======Open TCP Port 80 in Windows 7 Firewall======
> **Product:** //[[zoo:zoo5|Zoo 5]]//
> **Summary:** //Demonstrates how to open TCP Port 80 in the Windows 7 firewall.//

Be advised, port 80 is required to be open for all communication in and out of the firewall. It is not adequate to simply open port 80 on the Zoo application. Rhino clients will not be able to communicate with the Zoo unless you do the following procedure on your Zoo server's firewall.

===== IMPORTANT =====
It is not acceptable to open the port's inbound and outbound traffic for just the //program// or the //service//.
You must set the rules for just the //**port**// as directed below in Step 6, or it will //**not**// work. 

==== Steps====

1. Open **Control Panel** from the Start menu.

2. Select **Windows Firewall**.
