======Animating the RDK Sun=====


You can animate the RDK sun in Bongo 2.0. This is a great tool to view how light and shadow will play on your model. 

It's easy to use and fast. You just open the Sun Dialog box. Press the Animate button and for all the changes you make Bongo will create a keyframe.
