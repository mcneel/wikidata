====== AccuRender 4.0 Standard Libraries ======
There are three libaries locations AccuRender 4 creates during installation.

They are Shared, User and Internal Backup libraries.

======1. Share Libaries======
These are AccuRenders default libraries. They are the primary libraries used by AccuRender.

We recommended that you not make modifications to these libraries, but rather save your new and modified materials in user libraries.

In AccuRender 4.0, the standard material and plant libraries on an XP and Vista systems are in:

   C:\Program Files\Common Files\McNeel Shared\AccuRender Libraries\Libraries
======2. User Libraries======
User libraries are libraries that are customized for the job or client.

We recommended that you make user libaries and save your new, custom and modified materials to the user libraries. Create new libraries and give special names to then like Boeing_Project.mlib or McNeel.mlib.

User libraries in XP are stored by default:

   C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\AccuRender\User Libraries
User libraries in Vista are stored by default:

   C:\ProgramData\AccuRender\User Libraries
See [[http://download.mcneel.com/s3/mcneel/accurender/4.0/clips/add_a_library.htm|Adding a User Library]]

The reason for not modifying the standard libraries is compatibility with other users in your organization or your clients.  If you modify a named material definition in a standard library, when you ship drawings that use that modified material to someone else with AccuRender, their rendering will use the standard material definition, rather than the modified definition, and your renderings won't match.

When you ship your drawing files to another person to render, send your custom libraries with the drawings, and tell that person where they need to put them. The [[rhino:autocad|AutoCAD]] eTransmit command will "packing" materials and embeding them in the [[accurender:ar4:dwg|dwg]]. Upon opening the [[accurender:ar4:dwg|dwg]] after transfering to another computer, AccuRender will prompt for permission to add these materials to the user library.

======3. Internal Backup Libraries======
The last library location is a backup for the default libraries.

If for any reason the McNeel Shared libraries get edited or corrupt, you can copy these into that folder.

In XP and Vista, these are stored in:

   C:\Program Files\AccuRender 4.0\COMMON\SUPPORT\Internal
