=====General Illustration - Nate at http:www.nateowens.com=====

I use Rhino for illustration projects, usually editorial illustration, but also some commercial projects. Some other software used for rendering and post processing include Carrara, PhotoShop. Some of the things I do with Rhino are used as a foundation for traditional illustration (kind of like building a model to work from) - for instance I did a Christmas card with Santa riding in his sleigh. I did the sleigh in Rhino... advantage being that I can rotate that to fit into my art. Final art looked like an oil painting (but was actually painted on the computer).
