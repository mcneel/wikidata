====== The Transparency Tab ======
The Transparency tab of the Advanced Material Editor controls a number of different properties associated with light passing through a material.\\ 
{{:accurender:nxt:documentation:reference:transparency.png|}}
    * **Intensity.** This affects how transparent the material is.
    * **IOR.** Index Of Refraction determines both the reflectivity of the material and how refractive it is.
    * **Translucency.** This is a measure of diffusion. High translucency produces a "sandblasted" effect, since more light is scattered randomly through the material.
    * **Attenuation.** This is a measure of the loss of intensity of light as it passes through the material. Sunglasses, for example, have a high attenuation.
    * **Dispersion.** This controls how much light is split into its component wavelengths.
    * **Saturation.** This determines the amount of dispersion.
    * **No Daylight Portal.** This checkbox prevents the material from becoming a source of sunlight for an interior rendering.
    * **Glow.** This creates the illusion of illumination.
