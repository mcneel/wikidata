=====Question=====
I have a new computer and I want to install Rhino version 5.  I have always purchased upgrade versions of Rhino.  Do I have to install ALL previous versions and successive service packs??

=====Answer=====
**No**, but you will need the new V5 key code and the key code from your previous version of Rhino.\\
Download a new, full installer for Rhino V5 from the Download page on the Rhino Web site. Run the installer using your new V5 upgrade license key code. During the install, you will be asked to enter the license key code from your previous version of Rhino.
